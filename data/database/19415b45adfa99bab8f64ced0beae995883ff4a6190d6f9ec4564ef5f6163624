You would select “text” on your television remote, then type in the number of the page you wanted to read, then wait for ages, then the page would (usually) pop up.</p> <p><strong>It sounds quite like the internet. </strong>Yes. Think of it as an incredibly bad internet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/14/leo-hickman-ceefax\" title=\"\">But it was popular</a>. In the 1990s, 20 million people in Britain used teletext <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/aug/24/deaf-bbc-ceefax\" title=\"\">at least once a week for subtitles</a>, weather forecasts, flight information, football scores and suchlike. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/apr/18/twitter-ceefax-demise\" title=\"\">It only stopped in 2012, when the analogue TV signal was switched off</a> and used for 4G phones.</p> <p><strong>Stolen for 4G phones, you mean!

It only has 12 pages of news for now, but it can also display tweets and pictures in that lovely blocky format. It’s <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/how-teletext-and-ceefax-are-coming-back-from-the-dead-1326145\" title=\"\">an experiment</a>, by nerds.</p> <p><strong>I thought they might be at the bottom of this.

The nerds are having a lot of fun. One of them has invented a way to recover teletext pages that are <a href=\"http://www.alphr.com/life-culture/1002880/the-teletext-salvagers-how-vhs-is-bringing-teletext-back-from-the-dead\" title=\"\">hidden in old VHS recordings</a>.

He was based in the UK but, as with most inventions, we let it slip through our fingers. The Americans improved on Robb’s designs, and the Indiana-based company Zimmer Holdings became synonymous with the walking aids.</p> <p><strong>Do I need to know any of this? The sun is shining, I could be doing something interesting. </strong>There is a point. Bear with me. Ask me the appearance question.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Come on. Everyone knows what a Zimmer frame looks like.</p> <p><strong>You are in a playful mood. Just get to the point. </strong>Fife council has declared a Zimmer frame amnesty. The council reckons 160,000 mobility aids are lying unused across the region, and it wants them back – no questions asked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/scottish-council-offers-zimmer-frame-amnesty\">Scottish council offers Zimmer frame amnesty</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Blimey, 160,000 sounds a lot. How many people are there in Fife?</strong> 365,000.</p> <p><strong>That’s almost one walking aid for every two people. How could the local population get so enfeebled? </strong>Look, this is a funny article about a Zimmer frame amnesty, not a sociological survey of disability.</p> <p><strong>What’s funny about a Zimmer frame amnesty? </strong>A council spokesman sums it up rather nicely: “Amnesties have been known to work for guns, knives and air rifles. Now it is the turn of Zimmers.”</p> <p><strong>A bit contrived. </strong>It is August.</p> <p><strong>Is there a serious purpose to it? </strong>There sure is. Age UK says lots of elderly and disabled people have to stay in hospital because of a shortage of disability aids. If people ransack their lofts and garages and return them, the situation will be transformed. Hurray!.</p> <p><strong>When did we last discuss Zimmer frames?</strong> There is a rock band called the Zimmers, formed in 2007 to publicise the feelings of isolation felt by the elderly. The band members are 65-plus, and in May 2007 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqfFrCUrEbY\" title=\"\">their cover of the Who’s My Generation</a> reached 26 in the charts.</p> <p><strong>Interesting, though they don’t actually sound that much older than the Who.</strong> As usual, you are missing the point.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> Rollators – Zimmers on wheels.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Zimmertime and the living is easy.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“The comedians at the Edinburgh festival should have some fun with

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Incredible value for money.</p> <p><strong>Hello, I’m thinking about going to university. </strong>Stop right there, my fine fellow. Have I got a guaranteed, once-in-a-lifetime, money-saving, wallet-caving, brain-straining bargain for you!</p> <p><strong>You sound suspicious. </strong>On the contrary, good sir. I am a representative of one of Britain’s finest seats of learning, and today I’m offering you a deal so insane that you’ll ignore my insensitive reference to mental illness: a bogof degree!</p> <p><strong>A what?</strong> A bogof degree! Enrol for an undergraduate course with me today and I’ll give you a free – YES, FREE! – master’s course worth an incredible £10,000! All you need to do is sign on the dotted line.</p> <p><strong>Are you for real?</strong> Yes! We need to keep up with the market. Sheffield is giving top students the chance of a free master’s course worth up to £10,000, Kingston is offering 25% off a master’s and Kent will give you £1,000 off <em>and</em> 10% off the tuition fees of any spouses or siblings who also want to do a degree.</p> <p><strong>This is depressing. </strong>God, I know. Don’t tell anyone, but we’re being pummelled. There are fewer 18-year-olds around than in previous years – and Brexit will probably stop overseas students from coming here – and we’ve got spaces to fill. It’s tacky, and I’m ashamed of myself, but what can you do? Anyway, STEP RIGHT UP!</p> <p><strong>This isn’t what education is about, is it? </strong>What do you mean?</p> <p><strong>Surely it’s about expanding your horizons and gaining independence, not about materialistic freebies. </strong>Oh, I can tell you’re a hard nut to crack, sir. What if I threw in some Premier League football tickets? That’s what De Montfort is doing.</p> <p><strong>Good God, is it really? </strong>Please sir, I need this. Just say the word. You want an iPad too? We’ve got iPads as far as the eye can see! I’ll give you 10 iPads!</p> <p><strong>You’re doing nothing to dismiss the sensation that education is becoming something you can buy off the peg. </strong>Fine, I’ll give you the keys to my car and that’s my final offer.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Education is not simply a monetary transaction.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Chuck in a set of steak knives and I’m in.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"399","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-11T10:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T10:03:22Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T10:41:51Z","internalComposerCode":"57a858eae4b0f5d064841698","internalOctopusCode":"11790158","internalPageCode":"2639186","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-10T15:29:52Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Its <a href=\"http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/228.html\" title=\"\">website</a> has just been updated specifically to warn off people like you.</p> <p><strong>What does it say</strong>? “In general, the governing factor in the case of an original Grant of Arms is the domicile of the petitioner rather than the ownership of property in Scotland.” Basically, you don’t get a coat of arms unless you actually live in Scotland. Do you live in Scotland?</p> <p><strong>No.</strong> It also states the requirement that “the petitioner should be, in terms of the Lyon King of Arms Act 1672, a ‘virtuous and well-deserving person’”. Are you a virtuous and well-deserving person?</p> <p><strong>Well, I call myself Laird on my credit cards in the hope that I will get a better table at a restaurant, so I suppose not.</strong> Just to make it completely clear, then, the Court of the Lord Lyon says: “The ownership of ‘souvenir’ plots of land of a few square feet or thereby, such as are marketed from time to time, is insufficient to bring anyone within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.”</p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>It means you are a weird fraud with ideas far above your station.</p> <p><strong>It does get me good seats in restaurants, though.</strong> It does? Where can I buy one of these titles?</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I am Laird of Glencairn.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And so am I. And so is he. And everyone over there. And so is that guy’s dog.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"415","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-10T16:00:07Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-05T12:06:10Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T16:00:07Z","internalComposerCode":"57a48132e4b03b51a99e0347","internalOctopusCode":"11783139","internalPageCode":"2631995","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-08T13:24:31Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

It’s a sort of unmanned till with an irritating robot voice.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for that. Now if you wouldn’t mind, I’m …</strong> Unexpected item in bagging area.</p> <p><strong>Yes, that’s the tin of chick peas I just scanned.</strong> It looks like a bottle of vodka.</p> <p><strong>Maybe it’s because I’m using my own bag, but I swear … </strong>Please wait for a member of staff to assist you.</p> <p><strong>Are you accusing me of stealing? </strong>No, but the University of Leicester is. A new report from its Department of Criminology suggests that self-checkout technology encourages even normally honest shoppers to commit theft.</p> <p><strong>How? </strong>Some of it’s accidental – people forget to scan items, or get confused by instructions.</p> <p><strong>That’s not stealing.</strong> Other times shoppers get so frustrated with self-service kiosks that they feel justified in not paying.</p> <p><strong>If the machine is messing you about, what else can you do? I have places to be!</strong> But mostly people shoplift because the technology makes it so easy.</p> <p><strong>You know what? I think the supermarkets want you to steal. </strong>I doubt that. The report found that installing self-service checkouts raises lost revenue by 122%.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Mobile phone scanning technology is just as vulnerable – the study found that at the end of a typical shopping trip, up to 10% of items had not been scanned, leading to “shrinkage” (loss through wastage or theft) of about 3.9% of turnover.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but they’re also saving money by making me do all the work for them. This free box of Shreddies is basically my salary. </strong>That’s a flatscreen TV.</p> <p><strong>It’s not my fault I couldn’t lift it on to the scanner! Arrest me!</strong> Unfortunately the technology makes it very difficult to prove that customers are deliberately stealing. One retailer admitted they almost never prosecute people.</p> <p><strong>In which case, I’ll take my Shreddies and be on my way.</strong> For that reason supermarkets are now introducing tagging systems so unscanned items trigger alarms.</p> <p><strong>Ah, do you have that here?</strong> Maybe.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Thank you. Please accept this voucher for £10 off your next shoplift.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Insert your Nectar card, and then turn to face the Taser.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"400","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-06T11:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-03T11:20:22Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-03T11:42:15Z","internalComposerCode":"57a1d376e4b031196bf5bb75","internalOctopusCode":"11776032","internalPageCode":"2629620","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T11:34:43Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pg49","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/89825f9ff3bdee7f24c904ab713af324d83c359e/0_13_640_384/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"45","internalShortId":"/p/4pg49"},"tags":[{"id":"business/supermarkets","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Supermarkets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/supermarkets","references":[]},{"id":"business/retail","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Retail industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/retail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/retail","references":[]},{"id":"business/business","type":"keyword","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/business","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"news/series/pass-notes","type":"series","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Pass notes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/pass-notes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/series/pass-notes","references":[],"description":"A quick chat designed to tell you everything you need to know about a story you don't need to know about"},{"id":"uk/ukcrime","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"Crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"news/shortcuts","type":"blog","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Shortcuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/shortcuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/shortcuts","references":[],"description":"Our writers reflect on the people, issues and curiosities in the news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK G2 Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"G2","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"Comment & features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/features","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"89825f9ff3bdee7f24c904ab713af324d83c359e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/89825f9ff3bdee7f24c904ab713af324d83c359e/0_13_640_384/500.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"What power drill?

Little Maurice is the name that Juncker, the president of the European commission, has given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/jean-claude-juncker-keep-list-people-who-have-crossed-me\" title=\"\">his special book of enemies</a>.</p> <p><strong>He literally lists his enemies in a book? </strong>He said: “I have a little, black book called Le Petit Maurice where, for the past 30 years, I have noted when someone has betrayed me.”</p> <p><strong>“Le Petit Maurice” sounds classier than “Little Maurice”. And less like he’s describing genitalia, too. </strong>OK, we’ll stick with Le Petit Maurice.</p> <p><strong>Has he really kept it for 30 years? </strong>Apparently so. During his 18-year tenure as Luxembourg’s prime minister, he would reportedly warn his opponents: “Be careful. Little Maurice is waiting for you.”</p> <p><strong>Who could possibly be in this book? </strong>You would imagine that it includes Angela Merkel, the president of Germany, who wants him to resign. And perhaps Marco Mille, the former head of Luxembourg’s intelligence service, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/luxembourg/10929711/Jean-Claude-Juncker-the-lurid-spy-scandal-that-forced-him-from-office.html\" title=\"\">who was once said to have secretly recorded a conversation with Juncker</a>. Oh, and maybe Nigel Farage.</p> <p><strong>Really? You think? </strong>Well, the contents of Le Petit Maurice are a closely guarded secret, but, if I were Juncker, Farage would get an entire chapter to himself, and it would be illustrated with doodles of him being torn apart by goats. And I would use blood instead of ink.<strong> </strong>And reading any of it aloud would summon an army of demons from the fiery pits of hell.</p> <p><strong>That’s weirdly specific. </strong>I know. I don’t have a lot of friends.</p> <p><strong>Why on earth has Juncker told everyone about Le Petit Maurice? </strong>It’s weird, isn’t it? It’s almost like he wants someone to steal it and publish it.</p> <p><strong>Or maybe he can smell a book deal. </strong>Yes! He’ll quit, Le Petit Maurice will be published in hardback and Hollywood will make a movie adaptation of it, in which Juncker will be played by Ryan Gosling and Farage will be played by a frog that has been left out in the sun too long. What a blockbuster!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “What do we have to do to get inside Little Maurice?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Keeping a book of your enemies is something that only teenage girls do.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"399","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-05T13:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-02T11:10:43Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-02T13:55:27Z","internalComposerCode":"57a07fb3e4b04a702984e346","internalOctopusCode":"11772598","internalPageCode":"2627574","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-04T11:36:09Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-03T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Are you a woman?</p> <p><strong>That’s none of your business. </strong>I’m just saying, because most women don’t have very much vertical ambition, do they?</p> <p><strong>Hang on ...</strong> These aren’t my words. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/31/saatchi-executive-chairman-kevin-roberts-put-on-leave-over-gender-comments\">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi’s executive chairman, Kevin Roberts, said it</a>, in an interview about why he wasn’t worried about the lack of women in leadership roles.</p> <p><strong>What did he say?</strong> A lot, including: “We have a bunch of talented, creative females, but they reach a certain point in their careers ... 10 years of experience, when we are ready to make them a creative director of a big piece of business, and I think we fail in two out of three of those choices because the executive involved said: ‘I don’t want to manage a piece of business and people, I want to keep doing the work...’ Their ambition is not a vertical ambition, it’s this intrinsic, circular ambition to be happy.”</p> <p><strong>So women aren’t being shut out of leadership jobs because they’re working in an industry that’s systematically stacked against them. </strong>That’s right. In actual fact, women are shutting <em>themselves</em> out because they don’t like the idea of mercilessly climbing the career ladder every single day of their lives until they can finally reach their desired endpoint of being exactly like Kevin Roberts.

I’m off to sunny Spain! Viva Espana and all that! I can’t wait to get to the airport and hit the ’Spoons! </strong>Hold on a minute. Are you going to drink responsibly?</p> <p><strong>Well, in the sense of being responsible for paying for four pints with Jägerbomb chasers and downing them all in half an hour, yes. </strong>In that case I must ask you to reconsider, lest you cause a disturbance on your flight and a possible diversion to an interim airport, where you will be removed by local police and possibly imprisoned.</p> <p><strong>But surely, as a Briton, it is my very birthright to start hitting the beers as soon as I’m through passport control?</strong> Maybe not for much longer. The new aviation minister, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, believes that pre-flight drinking has become a significant problem and now wants to “have a look at” the situation.</p> <p><strong>Well, that’s an enormous buzzkill. What am I supposed to do on a flight, read a book?!</strong> Lord Ahmad assures the public that he is not looking to “kill merriment” completely, so much as prevent scenes such as the one that unfolded on a Ryanair flight to Germany in February, on which six men were arrested for brawling on their way to a stag party.</p> <p><strong>He’ll never make it stick. If there’s one thing that nature teaches us, to paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, it’s that booze finds a way.</strong> I wouldn’t be so sure. You may soon find yourself screened for alcohol before you even get on the flight. Please breathe into this bag, sir, and that.</p> <p><strong>I’m British. If there’s one thing I am good at, it’s concealing that I am drunk when the occasion demands it.</strong> He also raised the possibility of restricting the opening hours of alcohol sellers at airports. So you may simply not get the chance to get smashed in the first place.</p> <p><strong>For shame. When are these terrible new guidelines coming into force? </strong>Possibly never. Lord Ahmad may be having a look but a Department for Transport spokeswoman says they have “no plans to specifically address the issue”.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“One pint of your most joyless and family-friendly ale, please, stout yeoman of the bar.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “YAAAY!

Everybody knows what a pizza is.</p> <p><strong>So you’re referring to the popular foodstuff.</strong> Yes, but pizza is so much more than that: culinary classic, cultural touchstone, stuffed crust abomination, index of civil disorder.</p> <p><strong>Index of civil disorder? </strong>You can tell a lot about a society’s deterioration from its pizza, <a href=\"http://qz.com/738707/your-pizza-delivery-guy-might-be-the-real-winner-this-election-year/\">if you know how to read the signs</a>.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of signs, I was once served a pizza that looked like Jesus, but I sent it back because it had anchovies on it. </strong>To be fair, we’re talking more about pizza deliveries.</p> <p><strong>And after they took the anchovies off, it looked more like Billie Jean King. </strong>Are you paying attention?</p> <p><strong>No, I’m thinking about pizza. Where were we? </strong>In the United States, where during a year of political turmoil and civil unrest, foot traffic at restaurants is about 5% down.</p> <p><strong>I guess it’s hard to choose appetisers when you think you’re about to be shot. </strong>Pizza delivery, on the other hand, is up, to the extent that delivery chain Papa John’s has seen its share price nearly double between December and July. Domino’s stock has also risen dramatically.</p> <p><strong>So American consumers have transferred the unacceptable risk of going outside to delivery drivers? </strong>It would seem so. Let’s hope they’re tipping well.</p> <p><strong>Pizza is a big deal in the US, isn’t it? </strong>It is. First introduced to the US by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century, pizza is now a $30bn industry. It is said that Americans consume about a hundred acres of pizza a day.</p> <p><strong>Is this trend for holing up and ordering in set to continue? </strong>“We expect this phenomenon will play out at least through the general election in November,” says restaurant analyst Chris O’Cull.</p> <p><strong>Or, if Trump gets in, for the next four to eight years. </strong>If Trump gets in, I expect people will start cooking their own pizzas, on discarded hubcaps over open fires.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Pizza is like sex: when it’s good, it’s amazing; when it’s terrible, it’s still pretty good.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And also, when you’re feeling bad about yourself, you can always order some online.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"404","commentCloseDate":"2016-07-30T12:15:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-07-27T11:42:55Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-27T12:11:51Z","internalComposerCode":"57989e3fe4b0e0542bbb2593","internalOctopusCode":"11757240","internalPageCode":"2623691","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-28T13:55:59Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The
