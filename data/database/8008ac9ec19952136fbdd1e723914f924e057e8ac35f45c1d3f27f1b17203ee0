Virgin said it would still run a full service in the event of a strike.</p> <p>In the current dispute, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said it was cancelling 946 of Southern’s 2,242 services each day of the walkout, and claims to have operated 88.5% of those remaining services to schedule – an improvement on many days in recent weeks.</p> <p>GTR said many conductors broke the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout\">strike on Monday</a>, with one in five rostered to work turning out in defiance of the union. Its managers said on Tuesday it would meet the RMT for talks “any time, any place, anywhere” to end the strike.<br /></p> <p>However, the RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said members were “solid, determined and united again this morning on the second day of this phase of strike action”, adding that he believed the public understood and supported the strike. “Our message that rail safety has to be put before the profits of Govia Thameslink is ringing out loud and clear,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"035d3797ac68a403280385655fe571e88683927d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/035d3797ac68a403280385655fe571e88683927d/149_114_5197_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commuters wait under the strike information screen at Victoria station in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commuters wait under the strike information screen at Victoria station in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Passengers on some routes faced crowded trains and stations, with some branch lines closed altogether, although some stations have been quieter than usual during the strike, with regular users either on holiday or working from home. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">Southern trains crisis: seven factors that threw services off the rails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The union, meanwhile, has piled pressure on the government by claiming it sabotaged a deal to resolve the escalating dispute over the role of conductors. Talks broke down last Friday between GTR and union bosses before an agreement was reached along similar lines to a deal in Scotland with Abellio.</p> <p>GTR said the RMT rejected a fresh offer. The company’s chief executive, Charles Horton, said: “Everyone is sick and tired of this pointless, needless and senseless strike, which is so damaging to people’s everyday lives and the south-east economy, and causing undue disruption and hardship to customers and employees. I urge the RMT to come back to the table to talk, have constructive and productive discussions on the way forward and shake hands on a deal. We are prepared to meet them directly or through Acas any time, any place, anywhere to let common sense prevail and give our customers back their trains and give them the service they expect.”</p> <p>Cash said the union remained open for talks, but added: “We were just getting into the detailed wording when suddenly the plug was pulled and our legs were kicked from under us. We have it on good authority that the deal, which would have enabled us to suspend the Southern strike action this week, was sabotaged by the government, with their director of rail, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/08/all-aboard-southern-trains-disaster-commuters-caught-in-war-on-rails\">Peter Wilkinson</a>, directing operations from outside the talks.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it had played no part in the negotiations. Wilkinson recently apologised to the transport select committee for comments he made earlier this year, when he said rail workers resisting changes to their working conditions could “get the hell out of my industry”, and predicted “punch-ups” and industrial action.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZoVvrUAoPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\">Damien Gayle speaks to the RMT’s Mick Cash and Paul Cox on the picket line at Victoria station</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The RMT is planning to protest outside the DfT on Wednesday. Cash said: “We want the government to stop weaponising the Southern dispute for political purposes and we want them to stop treating passengers and staff as collateral damage in a war that Peter Wilkinson has unilaterally declared on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/unions-demand-change-after-report-into-londons-cattle-truck-trains\">the rail unions</a>.”</p> <p>On Monday, the prime minister sharply criticised RMT leaders. But Theresa May’s official spokeswoman denied the government had a responsibility to resolve the dispute, saying it had to be settled between the company and unions.</p> <p>The RMT confirmed on Tuesday that 84% of its members on Virgin Trains East Coast had voted to strike over changes to jobs and conditions, which it claims could threaten up to 200 jobs. The East Coast franchise was in public hands until 2015, but passenger and revenue figures have come in below the forecasts of the Stagecoach-led joint venture behind the current operation, and unions fear that staff may bear the brunt of cost-cutting measures. </p> <p>While Virgin says it has given the union assurances, including pledging no compulsory redundancies, Cash said: “RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members’ jobs are under threat and while conditions and safety are put at risk by a franchise which is clearly in financial trouble.”</p> <p>David Horne, the managing director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said the proposed changes were for a “modern customer service proposition”. He said: “We have worked hard to ensure there are comprehensive contingency plans in place and I want to reassure our customers that the timetable will be unaffected, should any strike go ahead.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, fears that industrial action on Southern could intensify were raised last week as two other unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association and Aslef, announced plans to ballot station staff and drivers over plans to close ticket offices and a breakdown in industrial relations.</p> <p>While the industrial dispute has dragged Southern’s performance down further, the franchise had been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">plagued by problems</a> before strikes started in May. The Campaign for Better Transport and a Southern passenger group, the Association of British Commuters, are planning to march to the DfT on Wednesday to demand urgent action to resolve the problems and compensate passengers.</p>","wordcount":"927","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T10:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T09:33:11Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T10:04:53Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9a357e4b033cb0795e53e","internalOctopusCode":"11794728","internalPageCode":"2641671","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:08:03Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q5tt","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a02d63c9dbf13a84ecaf679b0b93b83090a99725/52_0_4044_2426/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"619","internalShortId":"/p/4q5tt"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day","webTitle":"Southern

Virgin said it would still run a full service in the event of a strike.</p> <p>In the current dispute, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said it was cancelling 946 of Southern’s 2,242 services each day of the walkout, and claims to have operated 88.5% of those remaining services to schedule – an improvement on many days in recent weeks.</p> <p>GTR said many conductors broke the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout\">strike on Monday</a>, with one in five rostered to work turning out in defiance of the union. Its managers said on Tuesday it would meet the RMT for talks “any time, any place, anywhere” to end the strike.<br /></p> <p>However, the RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said members were “solid, determined and united again this morning on the second day of this phase of strike action”, adding that he believed the public understood and supported the strike. “Our message that rail safety has to be put before the profits of Govia Thameslink is ringing out loud and clear,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"035d3797ac68a403280385655fe571e88683927d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/035d3797ac68a403280385655fe571e88683927d/149_114_5197_3119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commuters wait under the strike information screen at Victoria station in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commuters wait under the strike information screen at Victoria station in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Passengers on some routes faced crowded trains and stations, with some branch lines closed altogether, although some stations have been quieter than usual during the strike, with regular users either on holiday or working from home. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">Southern trains crisis: seven factors that threw services off the rails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The union, meanwhile, has piled pressure on the government by claiming it sabotaged a deal to resolve the escalating dispute over the role of conductors. Talks broke down last Friday between GTR and union bosses before an agreement was reached along similar lines to a deal in Scotland with Abellio.</p> <p>GTR said the RMT rejected a fresh offer. The company’s chief executive, Charles Horton, said: “Everyone is sick and tired of this pointless, needless and senseless strike, which is so damaging to people’s everyday lives and the south-east economy, and causing undue disruption and hardship to customers and employees. I urge the RMT to come back to the table to talk, have constructive and productive discussions on the way forward and shake hands on a deal. We are prepared to meet them directly or through Acas any time, any place, anywhere to let common sense prevail and give our customers back their trains and give them the service they expect.”</p> <p>Cash said the union remained open for talks, but added: “We were just getting into the detailed wording when suddenly the plug was pulled and our legs were kicked from under us. We have it on good authority that the deal, which would have enabled us to suspend the Southern strike action this week, was sabotaged by the government, with their director of rail, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/08/all-aboard-southern-trains-disaster-commuters-caught-in-war-on-rails\">Peter Wilkinson</a>, directing operations from outside the talks.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it had played no part in the negotiations. Wilkinson recently apologised to the transport select committee for comments he made earlier this year, when he said rail workers resisting changes to their working conditions could “get the hell out of my industry”, and predicted “punch-ups” and industrial action.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZoVvrUAoPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\">Damien Gayle speaks to the RMT’s Mick Cash and Paul Cox on the picket line at Victoria station</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The RMT is planning to protest outside the DfT on Wednesday. Cash said: “We want the government to stop weaponising the Southern dispute for political purposes and we want them to stop treating passengers and staff as collateral damage in a war that Peter Wilkinson has unilaterally declared on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/unions-demand-change-after-report-into-londons-cattle-truck-trains\">the rail unions</a>.”</p> <p>On Monday, the prime minister sharply criticised RMT leaders. But Theresa May’s official spokeswoman denied the government had a responsibility to resolve the dispute, saying it had to be settled between the company and unions.</p> <p>The RMT confirmed on Tuesday that 84% of its members on Virgin Trains East Coast had voted to strike over changes to jobs and conditions, which it claims could threaten up to 200 jobs. The East Coast franchise was in public hands until 2015, but passenger and revenue figures have come in below the forecasts of the Stagecoach-led joint venture behind the current operation, and unions fear that staff may bear the brunt of cost-cutting measures. </p> <p>While Virgin says it has given the union assurances, including pledging no compulsory redundancies, Cash said: “RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members’ jobs are under threat and while conditions and safety are put at risk by a franchise which is clearly in financial trouble.”</p> <p>David Horne, the managing director for Virgin Trains East Coast, said the proposed changes were for a “modern customer service proposition”. He said: “We have worked hard to ensure there are comprehensive contingency plans in place and I want to reassure our customers that the timetable will be unaffected, should any strike go ahead.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, fears that industrial action on Southern could intensify were raised last week as two other unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association and Aslef, announced plans to ballot station staff and drivers over plans to close ticket offices and a breakdown in industrial relations.</p> <p>While the industrial dispute has dragged Southern’s performance down further, the franchise had been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">plagued by problems</a> before strikes started in May. The Campaign for Better Transport and a Southern passenger group, the Association of British Commuters, are planning to march to the DfT on Wednesday to demand urgent action to resolve the problems and compensate passengers.</p>","wordcount":"927","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T10:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T09:33:11Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T10:04:53Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9a357e4b033cb0795e53e","internalOctopusCode":"11794728","internalPageCode":"2641671","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:08:03Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q5tt","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/a02d63c9dbf13a84ecaf679b0b93b83090a99725/52_0_4044_2426/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"619","internalShortId":"/p/4q5tt"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/southern-rail-strike-war-of-words-heats-up-on-second-day","webTitle":"Southern

Angie Doll, a Southern spokesperson accused the union of being inflexible and said that an offer which the company made to the union last week was still on the table.</p> <p>“Five days of industrial action is totally disproportionate for the modest changes that we want to make here. It’s making life unbearable for our passengers and the local economy and the RMT has the ability to call the strike off at any stage.”<br /></p> <p>Asked if Southern was being advised by the government, Doll said no and that any “conversations” were around the company’s own executive board. Referring to the plans for drivers, rather than conductors, to operate carriage doors, she said that this was a safe plan which would “free up” staff to provide a better service.<br /></p> <p>Paul Cox from the RMT insisted that the strike was about safety, saying: “it’s about stopping the degrading of safety on the railways. Enough is enough. No more driver led operations.”<br /></p> <p>He said that the months of disruption preceding the strike were because a “basket case” company was unable to run a functioning train service. <br /></p> <p>“That is not related to the dispute. All the evidence that is required is there. They [Southern] should have that service taken from them and the mayor should get it or go to a directly operated rail service.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68ebabad4c3f9059ecea3c72e9a677f695e7e1c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68ebabad4c3f9059ecea3c72e9a677f695e7e1c4/0_113_3769_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on a Southern train at Victoria Station, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on a Southern train at Victoria Station, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a8c3aae4b03b51a99e129a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T17:44:23.005Z\">6.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Evening commuters have been sharing their experiences, which include some images like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DannyJeremiah/status/762705474999508992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Haywards Heath absolutely dead right in the middle of rush hour <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/v0a9AcER44\">pic.twitter.com/v0a9AcER44</a></p>&mdash; Danny Jeremiah (@DannyJeremiah) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DannyJeremiah/status/762705474999508992\">August 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNRebeccaEvans/status/762700665907011584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a> train home is on time for the first time in 12 months!

But is it really legal to sack someone for the misfortune of living on a failing rail line?</p> <p>Yes, says employment lawyer Aye Limbin-Glassey, a partner at Shakespeare Martineau. “If an employee is regularly late to work, due to known disruptions, as has been the case for Southern Rail commuters affected by consistently poor services over the past few months, failing to find alternative travel arrangements could lead employers to take action arising from persistent lateness.”</p> <p>During the strike, bosses are within their rights to discipline employees who persistently arrive late, but they do so at their peril, Limbin-Glassey says. “They should avoid jumping to conclusions as this could lead to counter-claims.” Instead, they should make it clear what employees are expected to do and offer alternatives such as working from home or shift working, to reduce the impact on their businesses. It’s also important that each employee knows who they should report to if they do experience disruption, she adds.</p> <p>There’s not much employers who are left out of pocket by industrial action can do to recoup the costs, says Limbin-Glassey: instead, their focus should be on making arrangements so that there’s as little disruption to the business as possible. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a89dcce4b0f5d06484180b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T15:01:33.383Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The TUC leader has tweeted her support for the industrial action:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/762637076835799040\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Southern?src=hash\">#Southern</a> is an utter mess.

I have personally experienced week after week of cancellations and delays for getting on for eight months now.</p> <p>The strikes are being used as a smoke screen for a poorly managed company that seems to be in bed with the DfT. Management seem to forget or wilfully ignore that their passengers are human beings having to deal with their utter incompetence.</p> <p>I fully support the strike action that the RMT are taking, despite the impact to my day to day life. I have seriously considered moving away from the area so that I don’t have to deal with this on a daily basis, and my journey in is only supposed to take twenty minutes a day.</p> </blockquote> <h2>“It’s not the RMT’s place to say what is safe and what isn’t”</h2> <p>Richard travels between Crawley and London, and his usual 40 minute journey took one hour and fifty minutes. He has mixed feelings about the service, but doesn’t believe that Southern Rail should be immediately removed. Instead he saves his anger for the RMT:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nightmare etting into work today, however the strike service that southern rail are running is able to get people to work, albeit a bit late. Well done Southern Rail.</p> <p>I will leave work early today, as during the last strike action I was left stranded in London.</p> <p>People need to stop calling on Southern Rail to be removed. They are trying to modernise their service, the RMT seem to want to keep things exactly as they are, they are not interested in innovation or the enhancement of services through technology. They are the ones causing a nightmare for commuters. Why don’t we let Southern go ahead with their plans and if the service is still poor, then look at removing them.</p> <p>It is not the RMT’s place to say what they think is safe and what isn’t. We have rail regulators for that. Southern Rail have been given permission to make these staff contract changes, and should be allowed to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T14:08:38.808Z\">at 3.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a88c6ae4b03b51a99e1135\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/alice-ross\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T13:51:12.999Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It appears that Labour and the Lib Dems are lining up behind the RMT in their responses to the Southern rail strike, according to comments obtained from the parties by my colleague <strong>Alice Ross</strong>. </p> <p>Andy McDonald, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: <br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last week Govia Thameslink Railway GTR rejected the RMT’s offer to settle a dispute over conductors’ roles on the same basis that a similar dispute was settled earlier in the week at ScotRail. It has become increasingly clear that the barrier to resolving the Southern-GTR dispute is the Tory Government. </p> <p>The basis for an agreement is there and both sides need to get back round the table – and that’s why it’s extremely concerning that a senior civil servant from the Department for Transport is on the record as saying that the Department wants to ‘break’ rail employees and make them ‘get the hell out of my industry’.</p> <p>The country’s biggest rail franchise is failing. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25%, and promised investment looks further away than ever, yet Chris Grayling and his officials seem more interested in pursuing an ideological dust-up with rail unions than improving abysmal passenger services.</p> <p>We have a train operating company unable to make their trains run on time and a Government prioritising a battle with trade unions over fixing a failing franchise, and it is the tens of thousands of passengers having to endure miserable services who are paying the price.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments mentioned by McDonald appear to be from a <a href=\"http://www.private-eye.co.uk/\">Private Eye</a> story quoting a senior Department for Transport official, Peter Wilkinson. That story, like much of Private Eye’s content, doesn’t appear to be online, but <a href=\"https://insidecroydon.com/2016/06/15/southern-failways-civil-servant-wants-to-break-rail-unions/\">the Inside Croydon blog has written about it</a>. Wilkinson, who is the DfT’s managing director of passenger services, is quoted as saying of the strike: “I’m furious about it and it has got to change – we have got to break them.” </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jenny Randerson, Liberal Democrat Transport spokesperson, has said accused the government of turning a blind eye to customers’ ordeals. She said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The situation with Southern is a total mess. People are being left completely stranded. Some even lost jobs before the strikes because of the poor service, whilst home life is being ruined.</p> <p>As a member of the Cabinet, Home Secretary Amber Rudd has constituents being directly affected in Hastings and can only criticise the unions; the Government has to take control of this situation. It has the power to impose terms and conditions on franchises and is turning a blind eye to the suffering of high paying customers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a88c04e4b0f5d06484179a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T13:42:11.208Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ever, Twitter has proven a popular forum for commuters who want to vent their frustration at the service provided by Southern rail during the first day of this week’s strike action. </p> <p>According to media monitors Visibrain, there were more than 12,670 tweets mentioning Southern Rail by about 2pm this afternoon, while the hashtag #southernstrike had been used 3,815 times. </p> <p>The only surprising statistic is that there had only been 560 tweets in support of the strike. This didn’t seem to tally with the number that I’d seen scrolling by as I scanned the hashtag, so I asked Visibrain why they had registered so few. Georgina Parsons, head of UK communications at Visibrain, told me: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We obtained this statistic by filtering on all tweets containing the words “solidarity”, “support”, “supporting”, “stand with”, or “behind”.

For many it is the culmination of months of poor service from the operator. </p> <h2>“On my line 100% of trains were cancelled”</h2> <p>Simon Foulkes travels on the Southern service between Appledore to Ashford to access the high speed service to London. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Southern say they have reduced trains in an amended timetable to 80% service, on my line the number of trains in commuting periods was reduced by 50%. When they say the strike will cut 40% of services, on my line 100% of trains are cancelled.</p> <p>My local MP took weeks to respond to me on the issue, ignored several follow up emails, and declines to meet me in Westminster where I work. I’d like to see the Tory MPs whose constituents are affected by this issue acting together to cut through the intransigence, and to address the background fact that the DfT is driving the dispute.</p> </blockquote> <h2>“People were stood on the toilets just to have space to stand”</h2> <p>A commuter from Lewes, who asked to remain anonymous, reports months of delays and cancellations. He is worried about the impact this is having on his job: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to get into the office today for some important meetings, and having started my job relatively recently not wanting to have the strike disrupt the progress I’ve made. For all employers can be sympathetic there is a responsibility for employees to ensure they can get to work too. In my 14 weeks in this job this is the third extended strike, which on top of the regular cancellations and delays could easily be giving people the impression I’m unreliable.</p> <p>The only way for me to get to work on time was to catch a bus at my own expense to Brighton, and catch an over-crowded train from there, changing twice. What is normally a journey of an hour taking me twice as long. Already I’ve had to cancel a meeting later this week because changes to the bus service mean I can’t get to Brighton at a time where I can get a train getting me to London before 8.30. Relying on public transport has become impossible.</p> <p>This is all on top of months of delays, cancellations and short formed trains. One day last week we had a 12 coach train reduced to 4 coaches. People were stood on the toilets with others crammed into the cubicle around them just to have space to stand. This is without the air conditioning working properly too. The week before that a woman collapsed on the train and I’ve seen people get off early en-route overcome with the heat and crowding.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T15:36:36.745Z\">at 4.36pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a87ae8e4b03b51a99e10d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T12:46:54.642Z\">1.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Anger at Southern Rail is still simmering as we await the next bout of commuter chaos, forecast for home-time rush hour today.

David Leam – infrastructure director at London First, a lobby group for the capital’s businesses – has used <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/08/the-rmts-southern-rail-strike-is-ludicrous-shameless-and-wrong/\">an article in the Telegraph</a> to describe the conductors’ withdrawal of their labour as “ludicrous, shameless and wrong”. He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying issue here is the prevalence of outdated working practices, which contribute to the high-cost culture of Britain’s railways. While Britain’s railways have been tremendously successful in attracting new passengers they have been much less so at improving their efficiency. Government studies have identified a 40% efficiency gap when comparing our railway against other European countries, requiring passengers and taxpayers to pick up the bill.</p> <p>Reviewing the various assurances and commitments made to the workforce by the train operator and government dispels any notion that the employer is being too hot-headed. Rather it raises the question whether government is, in fact, being too timid. Is it really sustainable to go so far in addressing the concerns of a party that appears dead set against a reasonable negotiated outcome?</p> <p>Workers in all walks of life need to adapt and change as new technologies emerge.

Wait for 07:11 with friend from Earlswood as there are no trains from this station all week.</p> <p>07:11 is absolutely packed, have one free hand to write. A couple travelling in together are split as one gets on but the other can’t fit on. Thirty-eight minutes is going to feel a very, very long time before I get off. Worse than a normal strike day (been three so far) as people can’t work from home as five days of it. A lot more busy than usual. Rumours that last train home is 18:35 so best check throughout the day.<br /></p> <p><strong>Kate Hayes, 55, from Nutfield</strong></p> <p>As the Tonbridge line is shut completely during the strike this week, I rely on my husband to get me to Redhill. </p> <p>0648 from Redhill to Victoria disappeared off the app overnight so husband got an extra 30 mins in bed. Drove me to Redhill where I caught the 0720 (pretty well on time), busy but not overly crowded. No seat though - but am lucky enough to get one at East Croydon.</p> <p>0752: I am being held at Clapham Junction - stuck behind a train in front which has an “’issue”. People getting off if they can use Waterloo or “if they are in a hurry”! The train in front is apparently broken down, so now all of us are told to get off - and now stay on...! I arrive late but pathetically grateful in Victoria.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T08:28:35.186Z\">at 9.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a83e23e4b0f5d064841617\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-08T08:16:06.383Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A couple of photos from Victoria station as the strike gets under way: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ae5697b0ee083a4e1db10fe0c5fb3f7e27e6f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ae5697b0ee083a4e1db10fe0c5fb3f7e27e6f3c/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Would-be passengers scan the departure boards at Victoria station as Southern Rail’s five-day strike threatens huge disruptions to services.

Grim-faced, they streamed through the barriers at top speed.</p> <p>Steve Mansfield was hurrying to work after catching the train from Haywards Heath. “There’s nothing to London Bridge so I’m here,” he said. “It’s another half-hour at least... we’re all absolutely bloody fed up with it to the back teeth.”</p> <p>Brandishing his travel card, he added: “It’s a bargain for three and a half thousand quid or whatever.”</p> <p>Memi Galiatsatou, a treasury analyst from Worthing, said: “I had to take the bus to get to Brighton.

It’s getting out of hand. Someone has to do something about it.”</p> <p>Martin Simms said he was forced to stand all the way from Three Bridges, Sussex, on his journey into Victoria.

An emergency timetable, cutting over 300 daily services a day to help ensure a more resilient and predictable service, has failed to stem the problem. Operating company Govia Thameslink Railway now admits it does not know when what was intended as a temporary measure will be abandoned. To compound Southern passengers’ misery, five days of strike action start on Monday.</p> <p>Here are seven factors contributing to the mess.</p> <h2>A sprawling franchise</h2> <p>Its parent company, Govia, had operated Southern trains since 2001 relatively happily (stress on relatively – one key Brighton-London morning service was recorded arriving late every single journey throughout 2014). It had also operated Thameslink from privatisation until 2008. But since the two and Great Northern were linked as part of a new Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, problems appear to have been compounded. The franchise was drafted, in a relatively unusual way, as a long-term management contract due to the challenges any operator was set to face (with the Thameslink upgrade programme and the redevelopment of London Bridge). Govia Thameslink Railway is paid to operate a service rather than being incentivised to maximise the revenue, as train companies generally are elsewhere. That means GTR only faces relatively small financial penalties for not meeting its service requirements – with its customers, paying thousands for season tickets, usually having no alternative but to struggle on to the trains. </p> <h2>Engineering works</h2> <p>At the geographical heart of the mega-franchise awarded to GTR in 2014 is the <a href=\"http://www.thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/\">Thameslink programme</a>, which has seen years of track work and redevelopment of stations, and most notably the <a href=\"http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/12179.aspx\">rebuilding of London Bridge</a>. With the introduction of new trains, this will allow much more efficient, metro-style services in central London from 2018. But the programme has caused immense disruption to commuters now – and 47 million passenger journeys on Southern pass through London Bridge. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8468d0c5dbc40850abba38d2312ebd3374f24a9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8468d0c5dbc40850abba38d2312ebd3374f24a9c/0_241_1410_846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hole under the railway line at Forest Hill which caused travel misery for commuters for the second time in less than three weeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hole under the railway line at Forest Hill which caused travel misery for commuters for the second time in less than three weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Rail/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond this work, Southern has also been affected by signal failures, flooding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/04/trains-into-london-bridge-cancelled-after-hole-found-under-track\">sinkholes</a> under its tracks – infrastructure problems for which Network Rail is responsible, but affects the train company’s service and passengers. </p> <h2>New trains</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/commuters-to-benefit-from-state-of-the-art-electric-trains\">Rolling stock </a>ordered for both Southern and Thameslink will eventually mean more capacity for passengers but presented another logistical issue for GTR. It means retraining drivers: taking them off the normal operational timetable (trainers as well as trainees), contributing to staff shortages (see below). And the new trains also are intended for driver-only operation, potentially allowing conductors to be phased out as the driver takes sole charge of the doors – the issue at the heart of the industrial dispute.</p> <h2>Staff shortages</h2> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/news-parliament-2015/improving-rail-passenger-experience-evidence-16-17/\">Commons select committee hearing</a>,  GTR admitted that it had underestimated the shortfall in drivers needed to operate the trains. Even the numbers they had reckoned on would rely on overtime, something train crew were happy to do for a premium. </p> <p>But overtime requires goodwill, which has vanished rapidly, meaning there just aren’t enough train crew to fill the rosters. Among conductors, meanwhile, sickness levels have almost doubled since the first strikes were called earlier this year – an incidence that GTR and ministers viewed as unofficial industrial action, a claim strongly rejected by unions. </p> <h2>Industrial action</h2> <p>Strikes called in May and June this year by the RMT marked a new phase of unreliability on Southern. The RMT and drivers’ union Aslef have agreed to oppose any extension of driver-only operation on trains, with the unions believing they had too readily conceded the principle in the past. Southern argues that it is an established practice on much of the British railway network – including on other parts of the GTR franchise. Longer trains have CCTV in the driver’s cab which should allow them to see clearly if anyone is attempting to board. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05cae360628901bd8d40a4fcfa6cc40c58b92d05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05cae360628901bd8d40a4fcfa6cc40c58b92d05/0_311_4974_2984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In response to industrial action and high levels of staff sickness, Southern cut 350 trains per day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In response to industrial action and high levels of staff sickness, Southern cut 350 trains per day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many in the industry, including the Rail Safety and Standards Board, agree that it is fundamentally safe, with more station staff deployed to help dispatch a train on stations with curved platforms, or where there is reduced visibility. Unions, though, have <a href=\"http://www.rmt.org.uk/news/publications/the-safety-critical-role-of-the-guard-2016/\">compiled a list of incidents</a> where passengers have been seriously injured when trapped between the train and platform or dragged along in closing doors. It is likely that risk analysts consider the numbers at an acceptably low level: the Department for Transport puts the value of preventing a fatality at about £1.96m (based on 2014 figures adjusted for inflation). For some, the question of who opens the doors is itself less of a concern than the fear that, once this duty is removed, conductors would be regarded as expendable, whatever the current pledges on having a second onboard staff member – with implications for passenger safety in unattended carriages, as well as in the possible event of an accident or the driver being incapacitated.</p> <h2>Growth in rail usage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1419abe589d8d80a1abef53cd7ef419b68ca0e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1419abe589d8d80a1abef53cd7ef419b68ca0e0c/0_129_1640_2172/755.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers standing in a crowded carriage on board a rush-hour Southern train from Brighton to London.\" width=\"755\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers standing in a crowded carriage on board a rush-hour Southern train from Brighton to London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Roberts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://orr.gov.uk/news-and-media/email-alerts/2015/rail-passenger-journeys-reached-a-record-high-of-1.65-billion-between-2014-2015\">Rail passenger numbers</a> have grown to record levels and three-quarters of journeys are around London and the south-east. More people pushed further out by house prices and looking to commute by rail, more pressure on services: there are 620,000 passenger journeys per day on Southern trains alone. Problems with rolling stock have also contributed to Southern often running shorter trains, exacerbating overcrowding. As well as being unpleasant for passengers – and making it impossible for some to board – crowding prolongs what should be quick stops at stations on busy commuter routes, meaning delays accumulate further. </p> <h2>The financial context </h2> <p>The stated ambition of the government has been to drive down the costs of rail, transferring more of the cost from taxpayer to passengers – but raising fares has become politically toxic. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/16/railways-roy-mc-nulty-review\">2011 report by Sir Roy McNulty</a> said that costs in the UK were up to a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/4203/realising-the-potential-of-gb-rail-summary.pdf\">third more expensive than in comparable European countries</a>, for a variety of reasons.

But bosses reiterated their determination to force through changes that have led unions to strike. </p> <p>While some commuters experienced extreme overcrowding on trains that were running, other services and many stations were quieter, suggesting that many people had not attempted to travel into London by train on Monday.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The strike will run until Friday night in an escalating dispute over the role of conductors. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it still remained available for meaningful negotiations, but believes an agreement with GTR similar to the deal reached in Scotland was blocked by the Department for Transport as talks <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/southern-rail-strike-talks-start-with-hopes-of-breakthrough\">collapsed near a conclusion at Acas last Friday</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/southern-trains-crisis-seven-factors-that-threw-services-off-the-rails\">Southern trains crisis: seven factors that threw services off the rails</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An emergency timetable is in place, with Southern saying it will run 60% of normal services, rather than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/05/southern-apologises-axes-341-trains-day-new-timetable\">85% it has been running</a> since last month in an attempt to provide a more accurate timetable. Some areas of Sussex will have no trains at all.</p> <p>RMT members formed picket lines at rail depots, and at London Victoria and Brighton stations.</p> <p>The union’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said he shared the frustration of passengers, but added: “This action has been forced on us by the arrogance and inaction of Govia Thameslink and the government, who have made it clear that they have no interest in resolving this dispute or in tackling the daily chaos on Southern.</p> <p>“Our fight is with the company and the government, who have dragged this franchise into total meltdown.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZoVvrUAoPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZoVvrUAoPE\">Damien Gayle speaks to the RMT’s Mick Cash and Paul Cox on the picket line at Victoria station</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>GTR said it had offered new assurances on jobs to the union, but that the company was pressing ahead with plans to change the role of conductors this month. Its chief executive, Charles Horton, said the strike was “completely unacceptable, unjustified and unnecessary”.</p> <p>“We want to run new and modern trains to provide more space and capacity, and we want to make essential changes to how we operate, including giving our drivers responsibility for closing train doors, so that onboard staff can focus on helping you during your journey,” he said in a message to passengers.</p> <p>The prime minister, Theresa May, sharply criticised RMT leaders. Her official spokeswoman said: “The prime minister strongly condemns the strike action. It is only going to cause more disruption and misery for passengers. We are disappointed to see that union bosses are overlooking the impact that they are having on the public.” She added: “We obviously want to see this situation resolved.”</p> <p>Asked whether May might back calls for GTR to be stripped of the Southern franchise because of the persistent shortcomings in the service, the spokeswoman said: “It’s not as simple or straightforward as saying there’s one answer or one solution. You would have to think carefully about whether that would create more uncertainty.” </p> <p>May’s spokeswoman denied that the government had a responsibility to step in and resolve the dispute, saying it had to be settled between the company and unions.</p> <p>Labour blamed the government for the strike. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “The country’s biggest rail franchise is failing. Passengers are enduring the worst delays in the country, fares are up 25% and promised investment looks further away than ever, yet the Tory government seems more interested in pursuing an ideological dust-up with rail unions than improving abysmal passenger services.”</p> <p>With services cancelled, London Victoria station, Southern’s main terminus, was also quieter than usual on Monday morning. Just a few hundred commuters stood waiting as the public address system announced cancellation after cancellation “due to a shortage of train crew”.</p> <p>Arriving on the 7.54am train from Brighton, which was six minutes late, Steve Mansfield was hurrying to work after catching the service at Haywards Heath. “There’s nothing to London Bridge so I’m here,” he said. “It’s another half hour at least … We’re all absolutely bloody fed up with it to the back teeth.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/southern-rail-service-disabled-passengers\">Southern’s rail service is disastrous. For disabled passengers, it’s even worse | Penny Pepper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brandishing his travel card, he said: “It’s a bargain for three and a half thousand quid or whatever.”</p> <p>Memi Galiatsatou, a treasury analyst from Worthing, West Sussex, said: “I had to take the bus to get to Brighton. I paid £7 for a return ticket on top of my normal fare.” Asked about the industrial dispute, she said: “I think it’s ridiculous. It’s been two and a half months now. It’s getting out of hand. Someone has to do something about it.”</p> <p>Martin Simms said he was forced to stand all the way from Three Bridges, West Sussex, on his journey into Victoria. Unions and management had performed poorly, he said. “They shouldn’t inconvenience the public as much as they have done. It’s taken too long. We are suffering.”</p> <p>Other commuters reported a better journey than usual. James Aitchison, 43, a publisher who commutes from Haywards Heath to Victoria and caught the 8.33am Gatwick Express, said he had a dream journey, with a quiet station and a few spare seats on the train.</p> <p>“The train got to Victoria on time, despite idling for several minutes at Gatwick airport and Clapham Junction, which is just a reflection of the bloated journey times in the official timetables to increase the chances of trains arriving on time,” he said.</p> <p>In some suburban stations, however, overcrowding was apparently far worse than usual. Jonathan Ricketts, 34, a commuter from Reigate in Surrey, said: “The 7.11am is absolutely packed … A couple travelling in together are split as one gets on but the other can’t fit on. Thirty-eight minutes is going to feel a very, very long time before I get off.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cec336e80004bc8f440eeccbef1892e9fda64842\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cec336e80004bc8f440eeccbef1892e9fda64842/0_172_5395_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign informs passengers of industrial action on Southern at Peckham Rye station in south-east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign informs passengers of the industrial action at Peckham Rye station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The evening rush hour could prove more disruptive for commuters, with services limited even if they run smoothly, user groups said. The passengers’ group for the Redhill and Reigate district in Surrey, one of the worst affected by the disruption, said the RMT and the company were holding users in contempt.</p> <p>The group’s spokesman, Stephen Trigg, said: “Rail users are again going to find total failure in trying to go about their daily lives. Last trains this week to Redhill are around 7pm … All in all, another heavy slap in the face for the poor, tired and frustrated commuters.”</p> <p>Speaking at the picket line at Victoria, the RMT’s regional organiser for the south-east, Paul Cox, said: “I do agree with the majority of the public now, it’s important that this company is removed from the franchise and a new operator brought in. We can get on with providing a safe, efficient service that people in the south-east deserve.”</p> <p>Planned industrial action in Scotland was called off last week after Abellio ScotRail agreed to renegotiate the role of guards in a similar dispute. Cox said: “Why is it good enough for an agreement in Scotland and have it rejected in the south-east? What is the rationale for that? Different executives.”</p> <p>But Horton told the BBC that GTR was adamant it would be starting moves later this month to phase out conductors and bring in planned onboard supervisors, with drivers responsible for closing the doors. “We will be making that change … It will move things forward,” he said.<br /></p> <p>Heeding calls for him or his company to quit would simply leave the franchise leaderless and delay improvements for passengers, he said. “We have been talking about this change for nine months. The RMT have set their face against modernisation.”</p> <p>Politicians on all sides have called for Southern to be stripped of the franchise, although many have also strongly criticised the RMT. Huw Merriman, a member of the transport select committee and the MP for the badly affected Bexhill and Battle constituency in East Sussex, who commutes on Southern, said he believed the action was unjustified. </p> <p>He added, however: “This situation has become so serious that I believe the Department for Transport should join the negotiations to assess if they can make a commitment to onboard staffing levels beyond the end of the current Southern franchise.”</p> <p>The week-long strike comes shortly before annual fare rises are revealed. Unless ministers intervene, fares are due to go up by the retail price index inflation rate, published on 16 August, which is likely to add another £65 to annual season tickets from Brighton to London. </p> <p>Campaigners have demanded that Southern fares be frozen in recognition of the disruption. An announcement on further compensation is also expected from the government.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"4","wordcount":"1471","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-10T14:21:36Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-07T13:43:04Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T14:21:36Z","internalComposerCode":"57a73ae8e4b0f5d0648412cc","internalOctopusCode":"11791981","internalPageCode":"2637289","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T09:20:37Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pqta","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e47ad334ba72099dd46027f350c24a0f5ce3bd21/0_166_4384_2631/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1786","internalShortId":"/p/4pqta"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout","webTitle":"Southern rail strike: no end in sight on first day of five-day action","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T16:40:31Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/07/southern-railway-passengers-week-disruption-rmt-strike-union-five-day-walkout","rights":{"syndicatable":"false"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2621134","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"cdea2efe5fa5cfb4b6e5eef837b402c6067c83c9","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdea2efe5fa5cfb4b6e5eef837b402c6067c83c9/0_374_5616_3370/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"People wait to board a Southern train.","caption":"People wait to board a Southern train.

But boy have I been angry! </p> <p>Tonight, hurrah, I have a seat on my favourite train home, the 1819. It used to be direct to Nutfield; since the reduced timetable I have to change at Redhill. There are no direct trains any more. But it is leaving on time. That, at least, is a huge improvement. </p> <p>Generally they don’t hold any connecting trains, and a missed connection is an hour’s wait. By 1858 we’re running 10 mins late – no hints why from the train staff … but we catch the connection and arrive only 15 minutes later than I would have been on a through train.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/20/sadiq-khan-southern-rail-transport-for-london-takeover\">Sadiq Khan seeks Transport for London takeover of Southern</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Friday 15 July</strong><br /></p> <p>0634 to Redhill on time. All is running smoothly. Fridays are always quieter and chattier.</p> <p>I leave work earlier than I used to as the evening delays have really taken their toll. Made the 1819 from Victoria and things look good but then we are told there is no driver . At 1831 the driver turns up and off we go. The connection is held in Redhill – we run round and all make it. We celebrate only being 15 minutes late again.</p> <p><strong>Monday 18 July </strong><br /></p> <p>Dodgy start to the new week. Arriving 12 mins late is depressingly acceptable by recent standards.</p> <p>In the evening it is pretty chaotic as expected. Barrier staff say they know nothing except that I have missed the 1932. Even by Southern standards this made me smile, because it is 1945. The 1940 leaves at 2009. Not a word from driver or conductor about the delay but I have a seat and we are moving.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 19 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Helpfully, as there are no trains to London Bridge, the Victoria train is formed of eight rather than 12 carriages. We are all standing, squashed, from Redhill. By Coulsdon South we are jammed, not just squashed . A driver apologises for the slow running of the train … there are dogs on the track.</p> <p>I can’t see the carriage door because I am jammed in by the lavatory. There is not an inch of space. Hot, subdued, resigned commuters get an apology at Victoria but no explanation for the lack of carriages.</p> <p>The evening is a disaster: the 2032 leaves at 2138. We arrive at Redhill 75 minutes late. The staff at Victoria had given up and were mostly invisible.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 20 July</strong><br /></p> <p>At home. Dentist. No train journey is some consolation for root canal treatment.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 21 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Morning journey is uneventful – although there is a Southern “meet the managers” session at Victoria starting as we get in. A real human voice – the conductor, presumably – raises a significant titter in the carriage when reminding us of this, adding “assuming they arrive on time”. </p> <p>The managers can string a good sentence together, littered with apology and apparent sincerity. No answers though. </p> <h2>Huw Merriman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7cf67819fed106a6cbad5c1047be5b08e6e637d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7cf67819fed106a6cbad5c1047be5b08e6e637d/206_294_2021_2970/680.jpg\" alt=\"Huw Merriman MP at London Bridge station.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huw Merriman MP at London Bridge station.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 43-year-old Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle in East Sussex commutes to parliament most days on Southern and is a member of the Transport select committee, which has launched an inquiry on the rail passenger experience for commuters on Southern. His annual ticket now costs £3,776.</p> <p><strong>Monday 11 July</strong><br /></p> <p>I board the 0643 from Crowborough which gets in to London Bridge on time. The rail minister, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/15/rail-minister-claire-perry-resigns\">Claire Perry</a>, appears before our committee. I explain to her that, to solve the industrial dispute, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/southern-government-go-ahead-cancel-350-trains-day-claims-rmt-union\">unions want assurances</a> over a second crew member being on the train but Southern can only agree to do so for the length of the franchise. The minister commits to the same assurance for the next franchise. This amounts to a 10- year guarantee on jobs and is good news. The minister and I then rush off to a meeting with other MPs who are waiting to be addressed by the new prime minister in waiting. With votes not expected until after 10pm, I stay in London rather than attempt a late commute and find myself stranded or on a bus journey until 1am.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 12 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Nothing eventful on my train service: my 1hr 40min commute runs to time.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 13 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Southern’s emergency service has been in play since the start of the week. In the select committee I was assured by Southern that suspending 15% of services would allow the remaining trains to run to plan. At Oxted, my train is mobbed because the next two Victoria services are cancelled owing to conductor shortages. </p> <p>A group of MPs whose constituencies are served by Southern obtain a debate in parliament. I ask for confirmation from the rail minister that she will be part of talks with unions and Southern to solve the industrial relations dispute. She agrees and adds that, if she thought resigning would help, she would fall on her sword. I return home on the 2008 – which runs late.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 14 July</strong><br /></p> <p>I return home on the 1908 – which is running late.</p> <p><strong>Friday 15 July<br /></strong></p> <p>A constituency day, driving across my 200 square miles. I am disappointed to hear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/15/rail-minister-claire-perry-resigns\">Claire Perry has resigned</a>. She has always tried to champion our issues with Southern and is one of the most genuine ministers in Whitehall. </p> <p><strong>Monday 18 July</strong></p> <p>I travel in on the 0713 to London Bridge – delayed because of signalling problems. A new rail minister has been appointed; I am feeling that we will now be starting all over again. It is 30 degrees and hot. A large sinkhole opens up under the tracks at Forest Hill causing cancellation of all trains from London Bridge. Not Southern’s fault but more bad news for passengers. I stay over in London rather than risk the journey.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 19 July</strong><br /></p> <p>After votes, I head to London Bridge and board the 1908, which is actually running an hour late. We are lucky, no other Southern services seem to be running from London Bridge. In Brighton, the police have to be called due to civil unrest by commuters who have had enough.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 20 July</strong><br /></p> <p>I am speaking at a conference in my constituency with Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove. We both catch the 1245 to London but it is delayed so we miss our 2pm votes. At least we netted each other’s votes out! I head home on the 1908 which is … late!</p> <h2>Hannah Little</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e03d58bc57ba49520a2621a3807f6ca7d654c3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e03d58bc57ba49520a2621a3807f6ca7d654c3a/0_0_598_797/375.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Little onboard a train.\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Little onboard a train.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 23-year-old charity worker lives in Burgess Hill in West Sussex and has commuted since September to Farringdon on a combination of GTR’s Thameslink and Southern trains and pays £3,500 for an annual ticket.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 12th July</strong><br /></p> <p>I get a train about 7.30am every day to Farringdon, which gets me in the office for 9.10am if it’s on time, and back leaving at 5.30 to be at Burgess Hill about 6.50pm. I don’t have any kids or responsibilities at home so if I’m having a shit time I can’t imagine what it must be like for parents and carers. At first, the commute wasn’t too bad, but a really bad experience on a short-formed train where I fainted has made me extremely anxious about getting on busier trains. I’ve seen numerous people faint on the train.</p> <p>Today’s train arrived only two minutes late and I got a seat. It’s standing room only at Redhill as usual. Arrives into Farringdon eight mins late. </p> <p>The evening train is announced as short-formed three minutes before it arrives, so I wait for another train and change at East Croydon. There are lots of angry faces and disgruntled huffs from commuters. I arrive home 25 mins later than planned. Time lost today: 33 mins.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 13th July</strong><br /></p> <p>Relatively uneventful, two mins late in. The return service is an eight-coach train, thankfully – the train on the opposite platform to Bedford is announced as four carriages, where a group of 40 six-year-olds stands with their teachers frantically now asking how they’ll get back.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 14th July</strong><br /></p> <p>Something must be wrong, on time! </p> <p><strong>Friday 15th July </strong><br /></p> <p>Blissful day off. Alert on my phone tells me the train was 19 minutes late home. </p> <p><strong>Monday 18th July</strong><br /></p> <p>AM – hot, humid and 13 mins late. PM – even hotter and more humid and 23 mins late. Time lost today: 36 mins</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 19th July</strong><br /></p> <p>AM – 13 mins late again. PM, the hottest day of the year. Parked outside Gatwick for an hour as two concurrent signals fail and trains are just parked on the track. Air con not working properly, so crammed on a train for 2hrs 15m. I am 57 mins late in the end, arrive home over 3 hours after leaving the office. Time lost today: 70 mins.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 20th July</strong><br /></p> <p>AM – sit at Loughborough Junction for 25 mins due to a signal failure at Blackfriars. Arrive in 33 mins late and run to the office. Hot and frustrated. PM – stay for a drink after work and to de-stress from a crappy week of travelling already. Still arrive 10 mins late. Time lost this week, 149 mins (in 6 journeys!).</p> <h2>Jonathan Ricketts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae0ad09c7882a00dda40d4014aa9d0be994b152e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0ad09c7882a00dda40d4014aa9d0be994b152e/0_369_1303_2223/586.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ricketts at Redhill station.\" width=\"586\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ricketts at Redhill station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The health service manager, 34, lives in Reigate but cycles to Redhill to commute to London rather than risking the connection. He pays £3,464, including London zones 1-6.</p> <p><strong>Thursday 14 July</strong><br /></p> <p>I’ve commuted for nine years on Southern: never an issue when I lived in Croydon with more trains, but I moved to Reigate in September and the commute has been nothing short of pain. I’m lucky that my partner is very understanding and stays at home with our six-month-old baby. Sadly I don’t get to see her much during the week as I often miss bedtime.</p> <p>Tonight I arrive at 2140 at Victoria station and decide to get a train that requires a change rather than a direct, in case the direct is delayed. Experience has taught me to get as close to home as possible while you can. Sure enough, as I wait for a connection I see that direct train was delayed: no explanation given. It is the lack of info that gets you. I get home to Redhill only 13 minutes late but in a panic not knowing when trains would run and what time I will get back.</p> <p><strong>Friday 15 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Runs smoothly.</p> <p><strong>Monday 18 July</strong><br /></p> <p>Should be 0704 – 0735. Reality 0711 – 0813. Home should be 18:19 – 18:58. Reality 1819 – 1912.</p> <p>I do a lunchtime check of trains to pick which one to aim for, as they often can be cancelled a few hours ahead. A sinkhole has been discovered at Forest Hill. No trains running from London Bridge to Redhill. Comical. Today’s board of reasons for delays are overrunning engineering works, amended timetable, sinkhole, and issues at Lewisham. Not even a mention of lack of train crew.</p> <p>I get on to the 1819 early, as it’s going to be busy with London Bridge passengers. I am stood jammed against a bike. Train completely packed, tempers fraying, many people unable to get on. Inevitably, the train leaves late as the guard is not on board. People are angry, unusually – normally they are just resigned and weary. I think after a relatively good week people got hope. Now it is being whipped away; as they say, it is the hope that gets you. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday 19 July</strong><br /></p> <p>The 0704 gets in to London Victoria on time (well, now that they have changed the arrival time in the timetable to a little later).</p> <p> </p> <p>I go for the 1819 train from Victoria, getting on at 1815 when it is already packed. At 1820, the driver announces that the guard is stuck at Clapham and we have to wait for him before we can go. The guard announces he was delayed due to signalling problems at Cooksbridge – never heard of it. Further delay at Clapham as passenger gets her finger jammed in the door trying to cram on. At East Croydon a man loses it as people try to push past him to get off and other passengers have to calm him down. Twenty minutes late in the end.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"14","wordcount":"2177","commentCloseDate":"2016-07-26T07:00:33Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-07-21T10:38:13Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-23T07:00:33Z","internalComposerCode":"5790a615e4b05c282c918fc6","internalOctopusCode":"11746117","internalPageCode":"2621134","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-08T07:45:26Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-23T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

As a wheelchair user, such events were rare but I’ve never lost the excitement of a train trip.</p> <p>Excitement isn’t the word I’d use for my recent journey with Southern rail. I’m yet another victim of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/23/its-the-hope-that-gets-you-commuter-diaries-of-the-southern-rail-nightmare\" title=\"\">atrocious service that they offer</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/southern-rail-failure-crush-unions\">Southern is a story of rail failure. But the real agenda is to crush the unions | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’d seen the news reports and heard stories from the many friends, including my partner who uses the line regularly to go to London. Yet I was only travelling from Hastings to Brighton. And I’m a regular user of rail services across the country. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Things didn’t start well when all the information screens were broken at Hastings station – not that they are placed in a particularly helpful position for those of us who are disabled or visually impaired. Then a concerned station employee became flustered at the idea of unlocking the station ramps, which most big stations have these days. When the train arrived, concerned station employee and an icy conductor somehow between them managed the incredibly complex task of unfolding the ramp.</p> <p>It was a smooth and pleasant journey to Brighton, although on arrival the icy conductor didn’t mess about waiting for someone on the platform and instead used the onboard ramps, perhaps to save time, despite the fact they are mean to use the station ramps.</p> <p>After a lovely day in Brighton I headed back to the station for my return journey to Hastings at 6.45pm. It was very busy with barely any staff on hand. At the barrier, I was told to find another member of staff who could help me. Eventually the someone else approached in hi-vis. I told him I needed the next train for Hastings. Hi-vis was at least friendly. “Get on the Ashford International,” he told me. “I’ll try and grab the ramp but it’s going in the next five minutes.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was gestured unhelpfully towards a ramped walkway, then a patronising man appeared and spoke over my head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I scooted down to the appropriate platform where the driver was getting into his cab as he saw me. “You can’t get on here,” he said, shooting off into the train and leaving me open-mouthed. Hi-vis returned sheepishly, clutching a bit of paper. “We’ll have to send you to Lewes,” he said, “Where you’ll change. Then get the train for Ore which will pass through Hastings.”</p> <p>I was anxious about having to change, but squeezed on to the Lewes train, the wheelchair space tight with cyclists and their bikes. At one point a man in his 30s got on with a baby in a buggy and we got chatting about the service. “Welcome to Southern trains,” he said. I was agog at how difficult it must be getting a buggy down and across the gap, which is sometimes considerable. “They should have sent you to Eastbourne,” he said. “It would have been easier to make the change there.”</p> <p>At Lewes the conductor couldn’t wait to see the back of me. An older woman appeared carrying the ramp, grumpy that I’d been “sent to her”. I said nothing. I wanted to get back to Hastings, which clearly wasn’t going to be before 9pm. I was gestured unhelpfully towards a ramped walkway, then a patronising man appeared and spoke over my head as he put on his hi-vis. The Ore train arrived and the patronising man announced that it was a very long train, so we dashed down to the end of the platform. Patronising man positioned the ramps and left with the parting statement “they should have sent her direct to Eastbourne”.</p> <p>Once in Eastbourne, for a 10-minute stop all the more frustrating knowing I could have gone there in the first place, there was confusion when it is announced they were “uncoupling” the last four carriages. As I’d been put in one of the last carriages, I was immediately in a panic. I asked my PA to stop the doors closing to make sure we could find out what this meant. After another wait, the conductor – who had left the train – got back on and we mysteriously shot off.</p> <p>I finally arrived at Hastings where there was someone waiting with the ramp, meaning I could make a swift and uncomplicated exit. I got to my car in the station car park at 9.10pm. The journey should have been direct and taken one hour and six minutes.</p> <p>When I contacted Southern rail about my experience, a spokesman gave the following response: “We are extremely sorry that Ms Pepper had such a bad experience while travelling with us. We will be conducting a full investigation into what went wrong and take action to ensure this does not happen again.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/southern-railway-failing-customers-cancellations-staff-shortages-delays\">Southern Railway is failing customers again and again. That’s why I spoke out | David Boyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The improvement to services for disabled passengers has taken years of campaigning by disability activists and allies. It was only in 2010 under the Equality Act that further <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/transport/transport/discrimination-travel-and-transport/disability-discrimination-and-transport/\" title=\"\">responsibility for transport access</a> was addressed. EU directives have helped to ensure that disabled passengers have increased access to travel. Brexit may sound the death knell for this progress.</p> <p>If you’re taking a longer journey, it is advised that you book your mobility assistance with the specific train company to ensure you receive the necessary support for your journey. For me, this is ramps at each station. I’ve done this many times, including on a trip this year to York, alighting the train without any problem at the huge and bustling King’s Cross. But I’ve also done the Hastings to Brighton trip regularly, and never needed to book ramps in advance. After all, sometimes a girl wants to travel spontaneously.</p> <p>As a wheelchair user I’ve travelled on the Barcelona tube, the New York bus system and I frequently use the Overground in London. Yet this recent Southern rail experience counts as the most stressful and confusing I’ve had in a while.

The union had earlier offered to suspend the strike planned from Monday if Southern could give similar guarantees to those it had accepted in a parallel dispute in Scotland.</p> <p>Planned strikes on ScotRail were suspended on Wednesday after operating company Abellio agreed to guarantee a conductor on every train with “full competency”, while entering into discussion with unions over how trains would be dispatched.</p> <p>In a letter to bosses at GTR, the RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said it was a “sensible and positive way forward” that would “bring an end to this dispute and enable Southern to start running a full service again”.</p> <p>But as talks broke down on Friday afternoon, Cash said: “It was clear right from the start of these talks that there was no serious intent from Govia Thameslink to engage in genuine negotiations and that their script was being written from behind the scenes by their government paymasters.</p> <p>“Compared to the progress we have been able to make on ScotRail, it is clear as day that GTR is being set up as a testing ground for a national union-busting experiment.”</p> <p>However, GTR said the union’s offer was a “red herring” and did not allow the company to modernise for passengers. GTR said no jobs were at risk and that they intended to have a rebranded “onboard supervisor” on trains – the company has wanted the flexibility to run trains with only a driver aboard should it need to, something it said the union refused to discuss.</p> <p>Passenger service director Angie Doll said: “We have gone the extra mile with our compromise offer, but the RMT has made it clear they are not prepared to negotiate. </p> <p>“We are deeply disappointed and angry on behalf of our passengers at this stance, which will cause misery for our passengers and untold damage to the local economy in the south-east.”</p> <p>The dispute has exacerbated problems at Southern in the last few months, with services thrown into disarray by staff shortages, compounding troubles from a new franchise and widespread engineering works. </p> <p>Currently it attempts to run about 85% of its trains, on an emergency timetable, although further cancellations and late-running services have persisted. Southern admitted this week there was no prospect of normal service being reinstated before September.</p> <p>On Thursday, with the addition of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/04/trains-into-london-bridge-cancelled-after-hole-found-under-track\">hole that was discovered under rail tracks</a>, cutting off many services to London, and a signal failure on the south coast, only one in three of the trains scheduled on the emergency timetable ran near schedule on the Southern mainline and metropolitan services, with one in six arriving at the right time.</p> <p>While talks were continuing at Acas, Southern said it would plan to run 60% of its trains next week, should the RMT strike go ahead.</p> <p>The dispute could yet escalate as two more unions, the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association and Aslef, have said they would ballot station staff and drivers for a strike. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/\">Campaign for Better Transport</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1208771822490198/\">Association of British Commuters</a> are staging a protest march in London next Wednesday, calling on passengers to join them to bear a giant letter of protest against the failing Southern franchise to the rail minister. The march, starting at London Victoria station on Wednesday 10 August at 5.30pm, will end at the Department for Transport, where they will deliver demands for compensation and a fare freeze.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"8","wordcount":"637","creationDate":"2016-08-05T10:50:31Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-05T11:28:17Z","internalComposerCode":"57a46f77e4b06a087f2af35a","internalOctopusCode":"11784978","internalPageCode":"2631816","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-05T21:00:26Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-06T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pj4t","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/10d506cf7f7e39052c9d38b3ae88627145341a23/0_218_3500_2101/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","sensitive":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"542","internalShortId":"/p/4pj4t"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/southern-rail-strike-talks-start-with-hopes-of-breakthrough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/southern-rail-strike-talks-start-with-hopes-of-breakthrough","webTitle":"Five days of rail strikes to go ahead as Southern talks break down","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-05T11:28:17Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/05/southern-rail-strike-talks-start-with-hopes-of-breakthrough","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2630251","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"56eb4f423c75c7871fc5bd5f5bafefe5d7f0379d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56eb4f423c75c7871fc5bd5f5bafefe5d7f0379d/187_285_3184_1911/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Southern Railway industrial actionFile photo dated 11/06/15 of a Southern rail train as guards on Southern Rail are to stage a five-day strike from August 8 as part of the long-running dispute over the future of their roles, the RMT union said.

But the rail minister, Paul Maynard, said the move showed the union “had decided that it is not on the side of the passenger”.<br /></p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, told a rally on Tuesday evening in Brighton – one of the cities most affected by the Southern crisis – that renationalisation was the answer. “If there’s one thing that can unite this party, and indeed this city, it’s campaigning to get rid of the Southern franchise and bring the railways into public ownership.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"13","wordcount":"410","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-06T16:15:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-03T15:16:06Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-03T16:12:27Z","internalComposerCode":"57a20ab6e4b031196bf5bcb9","internalOctopusCode":"11778062","internalPageCode":"2630251","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-04T09:01:25Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4phvj","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/56eb4f423c75c7871fc5bd5f5bafefe5d7f0379d/187_285_3184_1911/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"558","internalShortId":"/p/4phvj"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/03/southern-rail-staff-make-further-strike-threats-in-wake-of-new-disputes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/03/southern-rail-staff-make-further-strike-threats-in-wake-of-new-disputes","webTitle":"Southern rail staff make further strike threats over new disputes","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-03T16:12:27Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/03/southern-rail-staff-make-further-strike-threats-in-wake-of-new-disputes","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":"southern rail","lastModified":"2016-08-09T10:22:57Z"}]}}
