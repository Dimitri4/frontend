Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May’s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK’s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China’s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/hs2-bidding-process-opened-up-chinese-companies\">contracts worth nearly £12bn</a> to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands.</p> <p>A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\">10% of Heathrow Holdings</a> is owned by CIC.</p> <p><strong>Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Fears about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">allowing China such close involvement</a> with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour\">members of the intelligence community</a>. </p> <p>One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain’s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row.</p> <p>It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">independent cybersecurity experts</a>, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell.</p> <p><strong>Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\">blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co</a> to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China’s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman’s land is close to a nuclear testing site.</p> <p>Huawei was also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-huawei-nbn-idUSBRE82P0GA20120326\">barred from tendering</a> to take part in Australia’s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout.</p> <p>The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage.</p> <p>Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat\">threat to national security</a> by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon.</p> <p><strong>Why does China like the UK so much?</strong></p> <p>Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made.</p> <p>But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. </p> <p>Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-zhou-idUSBREA2T02S20140330\">appropriated by the state</a>. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/22/china-cambridge-university-poet-xu-zhimo-farewell-property\">put more than $12bn</a> into UK property, nearly a third of the country’s overall investment in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"1209","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T13:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T11:01:58Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9b826e4b0f5d064841c30","internalPageCode":"2641918","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:32:13Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q6vm","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"804","internalShortId":"/p/4q6vm"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webTitle":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","type":"article","id":"business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","editions":[{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","code":"default"},{"id":"uk/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/business","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/business","code":"us"},{"id":"au/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/business","code":"au"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[{"packageId":"f07e3ceb-03fb-4948-b3c5-8f419870e9b6","articles":[{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2647491","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"e5a3bf06cc90039e76266ce34d1768670d3ecc10","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a3bf06cc90039e76266ce34d1768670d3ecc10/190_357_2435_1461/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Hinkley Point C","caption":"A CGI image of the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.

These are cutting edge technologies that will also attract investment into the UK, create jobs and don’t come with a huge health warning.”</p>","wordcount":"594","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-14T12:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-11T10:03:16Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T12:05:00Z","internalComposerCode":"57ac4d64e4b024cdec3d6842","internalPageCode":"2647491","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T15:16:49Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qdt6","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a3bf06cc90039e76266ce34d1768670d3ecc10/190_357_2435_1461/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"698","internalShortId":"/p/4qdt6"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","webTitle":"May urged to pull plug immediately on Hinkley C over spying allegations","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T12:05:00Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2646200","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca/938_1152_1580_949/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Hinkley Point A and B nuclear power stations.","caption":"Hinkley Point A and B nuclear power stations.

Conspiring to unlawfully engage and participate in the development of nuclear material outside of the US carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a fine of $250,000 (£192,000). Conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government in the US carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.</p> <p>“The federal government has regulations in place to oversee civil nuclear cooperation”, said Michael Steinbach, executive assistant director of the FBI’s national security branch. “If those authorities are circumvented, this can result in significant damage to our national security.</p> <p>“The US will use all of its law enforcement tools to stop those who try to steal US nuclear technology and expertise.”</p> <p>Ho was born in China and is a naturalised US citizen with dual residency. CGNCP, the largest nuclear power company in China, is owned by that country’s state-owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council.

unpublished report by the energy department shows that it expects onshore wind power and large-scale solar to cost around £50-75 per megawatt hour of power generated in 2025.

This is the first time the government has shown it expects them to be a cheaper option.<br /></p> <p>The figures were revealed in <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nuclear-power-in-the-UK.pdf\">a National Audit Office (NAO) report on nuclear in July</a>. “The [energy] department’s forecasts for the levelised cost of electricity of wind and solar in 2025 have decreased since 2010. The cost forecast for gas has not changed, while for nuclear it has increased,” the NAO said.<br /></p> <p>The NAO cited the forecasts as coming from the energy department in March 2016. The department said the NAO had been provided with an early draft of its report, and the full version would be published soon.<br /></p> <p>Niall Stuart, chief executive of the trade body Scottish Renewables, said: “These numbers speak for themselves: onshore wind and solar will be significantly better value than all other large scale sources of power in the UK by 2025. <br /> <br />“It is time to start backing the two technologies to deliver the clean power we need to hit our climate change targets and the cheap electricity required to keep bills down for consumers.”</p> <p>Molly Scott Cato, a Green party MEP, said: “These latest figures confirm what many of us have been saying for years: that the Hinkley project is a dud.</p> <p>“The cost of renewables is tumbling and Hinkley will become a giant white elephant as it struggles to compete with cheaper renewable options. Research has shown that solar power would be a less costly way of generating the equivalent amount of power, and now the government’s own projections show that onshore wind too will be cheaper than nuclear by the time Hinkley is built.”</p> <p>Since coming to power in May 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016\">the government ended onshore wind subsidies and allowed communities to veto turbines near them</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/22/solar-power-subsidies-to-be-cut-under-plans-to-reduce-green-energy-costs\">axing and cutting various subsidies for solar</a>.<br /></p> <p>Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-section-6-renewables\">data published on Thursday</a> showed that renewables generated 25.1% of the UK’s electricity in the first quarter of this year.

Your predecessor makes a hash of things. Party rivals knife each other in the back or throw in the towel. You then mouth a few platitudes about a fairer society and, hey presto, you have a photo of a bemused spouse and a grin on your face before a cheering crowd. What could be simpler? It’s how they change leaders in China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/hinkley-point-c-mandelson-government-china-backed-project\">Hinkley Point: Mandelson urges government to support China-backed project</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is as far as we can take Sino-British comparison just now. While David Cameron carouses with his ennobled chums, May has to cleanse the Augean stables he left behind. Top of the manure pile is the deal with China and France on Hinkley Point.</p> <p>To May’s credit, she instantly did the right thing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">She cancelled the ceremony for signing the contract</a>. An empty marquee and some stale champagne were better than 30 years of lunacy. An embarrassed Foreign Office and a furious French quango were certainly better than the worst procurement deal in British history.</p> <p>But what now, when Project Pain says that Britain post-Brexit must kowtow to the Chinese more than ever? Businessmen will soon be lost in the turbulent seas of world trade. Surely Hinkley and China were to be their life rafts.</p> <p>Like all vanity projects born of globe-trotting diplomacy rather than hard commerce, Hinkley has become a sacrificial symbol of Britain’s desperation to “punch above its weight”. China’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaom‌ing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming\">admitted as much in the Financial Times</a>. He wrote not of energy economics but of “mutual trust”, of relations “at a crucial historical juncture” and of Britain as “a country open to foreign investors”. He forbore to mention Brexit. He merely implied that May was in a bad spot just now, and she had better sign Hinkley or be sorry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9deb3f1f0f46b770076bc296123c5e4cd7c04f96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9deb3f1f0f46b770076bc296123c5e4cd7c04f96/495_95_595_929/320.jpg\" alt=\"China’s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, wrote of relations with Britain being ‘at a crucial historical juncture’ over Hinkley Point.\" width=\"320\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China’s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, wrote of relations with Britain being ‘at a crucial historical juncture’ over Hinkley Point.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parry/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thanks to the incompetence of the Blair, Brown and Cameron governments, Britain will soon be chronically short of baseload (that is, not wind) electricity generation. It was hoped that salvation might come from a new generation of French nuclear stations. These have not worked anywhere, and to pretend that Hinkley is the answer has long been not just reckless but absurdly expensive. Only those with fingers in the nuclear till still excuse Hinkley – and they do not include France’s EDF accountants and trade unions.</p> <p>We smell a rat when lobbyists start using the language of Hinkley’s apologists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/hinkley-point-c-mandelson-government-china-backed-project\">Lord Mandelson</a>. On the BBC he did not mention value for money, but rather “invidious relations” with China, of “paying the price”, of world stages and goodwill. This is the diplomat-speak that dazzled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/george-osborne-renationalisation-britain-nuclear-power-china-france-privatisation\">George Osborne into negotiating his deals</a> with Beijing and Paris: he promised guarantees and rates of return inconceivable in current bond markets, at triple the current energy price to future British consumers – even assuming the project sees production.</p> <p>The argument can cut both ways. If I were a Beijing Westminster-ologist, I would argue that China should respect a trading partner that knows a bad deal when it sees one – and has a leader with the guts to admit it. I would argue that there are better candidates for China’s Trojan horse on to the world economic stage than a white elephant flopping on the shores of the Bristol Channel.</p> <p>Besides, Beijing should beware a nation incapable of building its own power stations, especially when its central bank is awash in cash. What use is a Britain that has to wheedle, bribe and bow to foreigners for a project that domestic investors would not rightly touch with a bargepole?</p> <p>There is clearly some nonsense in Downing Street’s reported reservations over Hinkley’s security. To question China’s good intentions in financing the power station is silly. It is a French-built plant, and the idea that Beijing might contrive to embed and then activate some doomsday bug is absurd. For May’s aides to witter on about Chinese duplicity suggests she has yet to shed her enthralment to Home Office securocrats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">Why have ministers delayed final approval for Hinkley Point C?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonsense too are much-vaunted “reservations about human rights”. Britain does commercial deals with all sorts of horrible places. The idea that China, any more than Britain, would allow its internal politics to be influenced by foreign opinion is another diplomat’s fantasy. Nothing was more hypocritical than British ministers at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, “raising human rights issues” with Chinese officials as a sort of burp, before cheering on a blatant display of communist autocracy.</p> <p>May’s team should do the opposite. They should shut up about security and discuss with China the constructive alternatives to Hinkley. These might include ways in which Chinese nuclear technology, not just money, might bear fruit in Britain, as in the new age of small-scale generators. Trade, as the ambassador says, is a matter of mutual trust, but also of mutual benefit. There is no mutuality in Hinkley, but there might be in “modular” reactors, as has already been mooted.</p> <p>The prime minister has to get this one right. She needs to show herself rational, decisive and immune to the blandishments of the Downing Street old guard. That guard left her a terrible legacy: not just Brexit but a bankrupt health service, crippled welfare reform, London airports going nowhere, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/07/hs2-the-zombie-train-that-refuses-to-die\">rail investment distorted by HS2</a>. Small wonder Cameron got out so quick.</p> <p>There are undeniable challenges ahead for British trade policy. One is not to capitulate to the Brexit headbangers and neglect a new deal with the European Union. Such a deal would patently benefit both Britain and Europe. The British voted to leave the EU, not to oppose trade with Europe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lobbyists may declare Hinkley a symbol of eternal love between the Chinese and the British peoples. So is a good dinner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Equally foolish would be continuing to countenance Hinkley. Downing Street knows what the Treasury knows and every energy pundit and commentator knows. They know what the French know and the Chinese know. They all know that Hinkley is a dud, a rip-off, a blunder. A bevy of gilded lobbyists may declare it a glorious symbol of eternal love between the Chinese and the British peoples. So is a good dinner.</p> <p>For Britain to seal such a symbol by agreeing to massively overspend on electricity for a generation displays nothing but idiocy. May has rightly given herself time for reflection. The kindest, boldest thing would be to bring that reflection swiftly to an end.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"29","wordcount":"1051","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-14T04:59:28Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-10T15:20:33Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T04:59:28Z","internalComposerCode":"57ab4641e4b024cdec3d63e8","internalOctopusCode":"11797609","internalPageCode":"2645374","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T07:59:44Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-11T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qakm","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd7a568d2beebd4ac2b05a364aff6d6722afbea/0_180_3600_2160/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"111","internalShortId":"/p/4qakm"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/trade-china-hinkley-point-dud-theresa-may-absurdly-expensive-nuclear-deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/trade-china-hinkley-point-dud-theresa-may-absurdly-expensive-nuclear-deal","webTitle":"Trade with China is a good thing.

The truth is that China would have far, far too much to lose if it were to start compromising other countries’ national security.”</p> <p>Moreover, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had put the country in a difficult position regarding trade, where we needed China more than it needed us, Mandelson said in comments that suggested that Britain could not afford to alienate Asia’s rising power. </p> <p>He said: “We are in a slightly invidious position in trade vis-a-vis China, despite the size of our market we are probably less relevant to China out of the European Union because we would be unable to influence that huge bloc’s future trade policies anymore and out of the EU we are probably more dependent on China’s goodwill because we will need to replace trade lost in Europe. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95/0_121_3200_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hinkley Point C power station site near Bridgwater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hinkley Point C power station site near Bridgwater.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“So we are not in the happiest of positions, but this is the reality and we have got to adopt a pragmatic approach to this. We can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with, whilst at the same time trying not to be a pushover and become supplicants in world trade.”</p> <p>Mandelson’s comments came after China’s ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming\">warned on Monday that relations with the UK could be jeopardised</a> if the government chose to cancel Chinese investment in the £18bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset.</p> <p>Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times: “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.”</p> <p>A government spokesman later<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\"> said the delays did not signal a cooling of enthusiasm for trade with China</a>. Treasury sources added that Philip Hammond, who travelled to China last month for the G20 finance ministers’ meeting in his first overseas visit as chancellor, was no less committed to securing Chinese investment into Britain than his predecessor, George Osborne, who had promised to inaugurate a “golden decade” of cooperation between the two countries.</p> <p>EDF, the French state energy company which is due to build Hinkley point C, brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board help spread the financial load by taking a 33% stake in the project. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex.</p> <p>The project is heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer, and the government has promised to pay well over the current market rates for electricity generated by the new reactor.

Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure.</p> <p>While not specifically addressing those concerns, Liu said that “security” was central to the debate surrounding the project, adding that the UK has “a state-of-the-art supervision regime and legal system”.</p> <p>The article comes in the wake of wider doubts about the future of the close relationship with China that David Cameron and George Osborne had heavily promoted. </p> <p>The ambassador, who said that Chinese companies have invested more in the UK than in Germany, France and Italy combined over the past five years, concluded by stating that it “has not been easy for China and the UK to have come this far”.</p> <p>“As long as both sides cherish what has been achieved and continue to expand and deepen our co-operation across the board, bilateral relations will maintain their strong momentum and work for the wellbeing of both the Chinese and British people,” Liu said.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/for-a-secure-energy-future-there-are-far-better-investments-than-hinkley\">For a secure energy future, there are far better investments than Hinkley | John Sauven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, French unions have said that the decision by energy firm EDF to invest in Hinkley Point<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/edf-decision-hinkley-point-should-be-declared-void-french-unions-government-approval-nuclear\"> should be declared invalid.</a><br /></p> <p>Three unions at the French state-owned firm said senior board members knew the British government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. </p> <p>Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, wrote to board members last week, saying he knew about the delay before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear site in a generation. Just hours before a signing ceremony was due to take place at the site in Somerset May quashed hopes that Hinkley would go ahead by putting off government approval until early autumn.</p> <p>Unions said they believed some board members knew of the likely delay, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned. “Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” they said in a joint statement.</p> <p>“They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.” </p> <p>The unions, CGT, CFE-CGC and FO, said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement.</p> <p>But Lévy told executives he believed May only wanted a few more days, and EDF said he had not been aware of any plan to push back the decision to autumn. EDF said it knew at the time of the boardroom vote only that a signing ceremony planned for the day after the meeting was to be delayed.</p> <p>“Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the Hinkley Point project,” EDF said.</p> <p>“All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on July 28 was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday, 29 July, would be postponed.</p> <p>“This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.”</p>","wordcount":"798","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-11T22:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T20:44:55Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T22:31:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57a8ef47e4b033cb0795e2f6","internalOctopusCode":"11793107","internalPageCode":"2640564","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T08:46:31Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q44t","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/852e242950d61fca0380afb3eaf190618f00c7ef/1054_423_2677_1606/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"614","internalShortId":"/p/4q44t"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming","webTitle":"China warns UK relations are at 'historical juncture' over Hinkley Point","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T22:31:10Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2641918","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"An employee stands next to the Chinese and British flags","caption":"An employee stands next to the Chinese and British flags at the Bank of China in Beijing.

Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May’s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK’s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China’s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England.</p> <p><strong>What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash?</strong></p> <p>Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/hs2-bidding-process-opened-up-chinese-companies\">contracts worth nearly £12bn</a> to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands.</p> <p>A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\">10% of Heathrow Holdings</a> is owned by CIC.</p> <p><strong>Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Fears about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">allowing China such close involvement</a> with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour\">members of the intelligence community</a>. </p> <p>One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain’s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row.</p> <p>It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">independent cybersecurity experts</a>, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell.</p> <p><strong>Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\">blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co</a> to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China’s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman’s land is close to a nuclear testing site.</p> <p>Huawei was also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-huawei-nbn-idUSBRE82P0GA20120326\">barred from tendering</a> to take part in Australia’s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout.</p> <p>The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage.</p> <p>Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat\">threat to national security</a> by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon.</p> <p><strong>Why does China like the UK so much?</strong></p> <p>Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made.</p> <p>But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. </p> <p>Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-zhou-idUSBREA2T02S20140330\">appropriated by the state</a>. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/22/china-cambridge-university-poet-xu-zhimo-farewell-property\">put more than $12bn</a> into UK property, nearly a third of the country’s overall investment in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"1209","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T13:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T11:01:58Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9b826e4b0f5d064841c30","internalPageCode":"2641918","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:32:13Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q6vm","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"804","internalShortId":"/p/4q6vm"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webTitle":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","type":"article","id":"business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","editions":[{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","code":"default"},{"id":"uk/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/business","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/business","code":"us"},{"id":"au/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/business","code":"au"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2642885","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95/0_121_3200_1920/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station site near Bridgwater, Somerset","caption":"The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station site near Bridgwater, Somerset.

The opium wars kicked off what Beijing terms, and <a href=\"http://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL59_3233.pdf\">promotes relentlessly</a>, as the “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers, ended only by the Communist party’s triumph.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay\">China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Chinese authorities’ claim to legitimacy rests upon their ability to provide economic wellbeing, which is proving increasingly tough, and this idea of renewed national pride, seized and amplified by Xi Jinping since he took power. It is one reason he wanted his people to see his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/23/chinese-president-xi-jinping-uk-visit-roundup\">red carpet welcome in London</a> last year:  the <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/06/15/china-is-an-unexpectedly-strong-supporter-of-the-remain-camp/\">former aggressor was now bowing its knee</a>. It also increases Beijing’s sensitivity to the 11th-hour halt on Hinkley Point and the public airing of suspicions about China’s behaviour and intentions. The undiplomatic handling will be almost as unwelcome as the decision. </p> <p>But the Chinese are pragmatic and the real lesson from history is that remembering the days when Britannia ruled the waves accentuates its decline. The UK is a waning power, especially since voting for Brexit, which “show[ed] a losing mindset”, in the words of one populist state-run Chinese newspaper. Beijing might, in fact, describe the UK somewhat as Lord Macartney, the first British envoy to China, described China: “An old, crazy, first-rate man of war, which a fortunate succession of able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat ...” </p> <p>China, of course, has no need to force open our economy, because we begged for its cooperation. Engagement and trade has never been the kind of political issue in the UK that it is in the US, where China-bashing is a regular feature of the electoral cycle. The Osborne Doctrine went much further. It looked like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/britain-trading-relationship-china-hinkley-point\">business at all costs</a>. And as plenty of diplomats have observed, Beijing does not respect weakness. </p> <p>We are useful, rather than important, thanks to the hangover from our imperial heyday: that permanent seat on the UN security council, for example, and our ability to set an example to others. We are less valuable outside the European Union – no longer China’s gateway to the EU, or its voice in discussions there – but canny investors may relish the prospect of Brexit bargains. </p> <p>China envies our soft power, too, which they have <a href=\"http://cmp.hku.hk/2015/01/26/37903/\">sought without success to buy or manufacture</a>.  Yes, we may seem quaint or entertaining – the country of Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and David Beckham – but the Chinese know far more about us than vice versa, even if they don’t always understand us. Their leaders have read Shakespeare and Adam Smith; you’d struggle to find British politicians who could identify Du Fu or Liang Qichao. </p> <p>Meanwhile, under Xi’s leadership, the talk of international friendship has gone hand in hand with increasing domestic stress on the idea that <a href=\"http://qz.com/751338/the-complete-guide-to-chinas-propaganda-videos-blaming-the-west-for-almost-everything/\">“hostile foreign forces” from the west</a> want to contain China and unleash its disintegration.  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/china-human-rights-activist-convictions-us-criticism\">Talk of human rights</a> is just another way to undermine the country, they say. </p> <p>What the UK and other western countries want most, as the former chancellor George Osborne’s strategy highlighted, is a stable China with which they can do business. Whether or not Theresa May decides Hinkley Point should go ahead, that is unlikely to change. </p>","newspaperPageNumber":"9","wordcount":"648","creationDate":"2016-08-09T17:13:22Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T18:27:04Z","internalComposerCode":"57aa0f32e4b033cb0795e79b","internalOctopusCode":"11795505","internalPageCode":"2642885","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T22:50:03Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q79h","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/80a7b7569b891b117040e2ae2432dc6ff485ba95/0_121_3200_1920/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"312","internalShortId":"/p/4q79h"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","webTitle":"UK will want to do business with China, regardless of Hinkley Point | Tania Branigan","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T18:27:04Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2642041","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca/938_1152_1580_949/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Clouds over Hinkley Point A and B","caption":"Clouds over Hinkley Point A and B.

</figure>","body":"<p>Britain’s nuclear watchdog was made to wait more than a fortnight for key files from energy giant EDF confirming that components recently revealed to be suspect had not been used in one of Britain’s largest nuclear power stations.</p> <p>Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in early May, France’s EDF Group initially rebuffed requests from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to hand over files about a foundry in France that made specialist parts for EDF’s reactors. The request followed a shock announcement by the foundry’s owner, Areva, on 2 May that quality control reports could have been falsified. The email trail shows the ONR was still making requests for a components list on 18 May, 16 days after the safety fears were first aired.</p> <p>Dr David Lowry of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies, who obtained the emails, said they raised questions about the regulator’s powers. “ONR has run into so many difficulties in obtaining safety documentation from the French nuclear industry. How will it obtain key documents from the notoriously secretive Chinese nuclear industry, if they get permission to build their own reactors at Bradwell, on the Blackwater Estuary in Essex?”</p> <p>The UK regulator feared that the suspect Areva components might have been used in the construction of Suffolk’s Sizewell B power station and that others were destined for the proposed Hinkley Point C in Somerset.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2016/Anomalies-suspected-falsifications-Areva/\">Greenpeace France claimed that “the potential falsifications and anomalies” </a>constituted “a major safety risk because the parts involved are large components which are essential to operating the reactors”.</p> <p>When the concerns emerged, an ONR spokesman said: “ONR is aware of the reports of possible falsification of manufacturing and quality control at Areva’s reactor vessel plant at Le Creusot. We have been in contact with the licensee and are looking into any applicability in the UK.”</p> <p>But emails suggest that the watchdog struggled to obtain information from the French company’s UK subsidiary, EDF Energy, to enable it to make an urgent safety assessment.</p> <p>An email from the ONR dated 13 May states: “We have been in contact with EDF Group and while they do have access to the Areva component files, they are not able to release them to EDF Energy.”</p> <p>The watchdog said EDF had informally advised it that none of the components in Sizewell B posed a safety risk. But, without access to the files, it had to rely on the French firm’s assurances.</p> <p>The ONR’s chief nuclear inspector wrote in desperation on 18 May to his counterpart at ASN, France’s nuclear watchdog,. “I am concerned that without sight of the full list of implicated components supplied to the UK it is not possible for ONR to independently verify the UK position,” he wrote.</p> <p>The ONR was left having to ask its French counterpart for a list of the suspect components or to “facilitate Areva sending the list directly to ONR”. It continued: “As you will appreciate, there is significant public interest in the UK and as a respected regulator it is important that we have sight of the source information without which the robustness of our public responses and our safety assurances are diminished.”</p> <p>EDF Energy insists it was ultimately able to access all the relevant files from its parent company, EDF Group, and shared these with the regulator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">Hinkley Point C in doubt after British government delays approval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eventually, in June, EDF stated that it was able to independently confirm that Sizewell B was not affected by issues under investigation at Areva’s Creusot Forge in France.
