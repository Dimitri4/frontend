Whatever does that mean?</strong> You might want to sit down for this. The Kennel Club <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4627470.ece\">could be about to recognise crossbreeds on its breed register</a>.</p> <p><strong>What? This is an outrage! </strong>I fully agree. The world is a crazy, mixed-up place sometimes, and the only comfort is that the Kennel Club can trace the ancestry of my pedigree spaniel back for a handful of generations.</p> <p><strong>And now that’s changing?</strong> Sort of. For the first time in its history, the Kennel Club is debating whether or not to expand a registry of selected crossbreeds to accompany its detailed pedigree registry.</p> <p><strong>But I’m a member of the Kennel Club specifically because it doesn’t let in mongrels.</strong> Me too. Mongrels are cute, and the Kennel Club is no place for cute animals. It’s a place for weird-looking inbred dogs that cost as much as a house and have stupid names and are riddled with hundreds of genuinely debilitating congenital defects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2015/aug/18/a-visual-tour-of-the-kennel-clubs-agility-content\">The Kennel Club's agility festival: a visual tour</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Could this be why it is doing it?

All the Kennel Club representatives are very <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/pets/12022568/Bone-of-contention-over-Kennel-Club-plans-to-register-popular-designer-dogs.html\">keen to stress the importance of health.</a></p> <p><strong>Oh God, it’s going to be a free-for-all.</strong> Maybe not. According to all the reports so far, the Kennel Club is only planning to expand its doors to accommodate designer dogs.</p> <p><strong>What’s the difference between a mongrel and a designer dog?</strong> A mongrel is a dog made of more than one breed. A designer dog is a dog made of more than one breed and owned by a celebrity.</p> <p><strong>I’m not sure I follow.</strong> Trendy crossbreeds tend to include labradoodles (owner: Jennifer Aniston) or maltipoos (owner: Rita Ora) or puggles (owner: Jake Gyllenhaal).</p> <p><strong>Right, so not any old dog will do?</strong> The Kennel Club is still in early stages of discussion, but it seems unlikely that you will be able to sneak into its good books by inventing an alsamatian (alsatian/dalmatian) or a dorgi (doberman/corgi).</p> <p><strong>Fine. What about a roxer?</strong> A cross between a rottweiler and a boxer? Yes, that sounds like something an X Factor judge would own. You’re in.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “If anything can get Crufts back on the BBC, it’s a cockapoo.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Maybe we should start something similar with the royal family.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11031298","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2415953","internalRevision":"54","internalContentCode":"458453245","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The most prestigious dog-breeding club in the world is considering adding non-pedigree animals to its breed registry for the first time.

It’s not a software issue at all.’”</p> <p><strong>Far out.</strong> You may scoff, but quite a few computing pioneers were psychedelic drug users. Steve Jobs reportedly considered it one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/06/psychedelics-computer-revolution-lsd\" title=\"\">most important things he’d ever done</a>.</p> <p><strong>I thought he was a massive control freak? </strong>Maybe the acid smoothed him out.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Turn off, tune in.

<p><strong>Initiate information sequence &lt;PassNotes&gt; </strong>Erm. OK.</p> <p><strong>&lt;Remark&gt; What is it today, then? </strong>It’s the Labour MP John Woodcock, who, during a debate on renewing Britain’s nuclear capability, <a href=\"http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/452741/mps-clash-in-the-commons-over-calling-each-other-robots.thtml\" title=\"\">said to his SNP opponents: </a>“I would have been happy to take every single one of you robots.”</p> <p><strong>Ha. Ha. Ha. Print &lt;AmusedFace&gt;</strong> Well, they didn’t find it funny. “Can we have some clarification on whether the charming expression ‘robot’ is parliamentary language?” the <a href=\"http://on.aol.com/video/mp-john-woodcock-calls-the-snp-mps-robots-for-following-party-line-519274629\" title=\"\">SNP’s John Nicolson asked the deputy speaker Eleanor Laing.</a></p> <p><strong>&lt;Question&gt; What did Laing.dep.sp decide? </strong>She said it was fine. “I have come to the conclusion that in some circumstances it might [be derogatory], and in some it might not,” she announced. “For the moment, I am concluding for my own peace of mind that the honourable gentleman was thinking of a high-functioning, intelligent robot and therefore, for the moment, I will not call him to order for the use of the word.”</p> <p><strong>&lt;Remark&gt; Opinion of Laing.dep.sp is invalid.</strong> Yes. I think that’s pretty obvious. But whether or not her opinion was valid, I think it means MPs can now call each other robots whenever they feel like being rude.</p> <p><strong>&lt;Question&gt; Why did Woodcock.mp designate Nicolson.mp and &lt;SNP&gt; “robots”? </strong>Because of their creepily perfect parliamentary discipline. The SNP MPs seem to agree on everything, and he thinks that’s weird. He was also annoyed because they wouldn’t let him speak.</p> <p><strong>&lt;Question&gt; Are Nicolson.mp and his colleagues robots?</strong> No. No, they’re not.</p> <p><strong>&lt;Question&gt; Is it weird to be a robot? </strong>That depends on your point of view. Woodcock’s Labour party is currently a total mess because it can’t agree on anything. Its leader never followed instructions from past leaders and is now struggling to convince the rest to take instructions from him. Basically, Woodcock wants to make it look as if the SNP are all scheming hypocrites for showing discipline, whereas Labour are principled politicians.</p> <p><strong>&lt;SNP hypocrisy&gt; and &lt;Labour mess&gt; do not mutually exclude. </strong>No. I suppose you’re right there.</p> <p><strong>&lt;Say&gt;</strong> “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.”</p> <p><strong>&lt;/Say&gt; </strong>“Exterminate English

separators.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 50+.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Middle-aged and alone.</p> <p><strong>That’s what happens when you separate silver for a living. No one wants to know. </strong>“Silver separator” does not refer to some obscure profession that makes you unattractive to others. It just means old and divorced.</p> <p><strong>But 50 isn’t old. And my hair isn’t silver yet. </strong>I see. Have you ever entertained thoughts of divorce?</p> <p><strong>I don’t know. Maybe when the kids are older. </strong>That’s precisely why divorce is thought to be on the rise among the “silver separators”. They stayed together for the kids, but now they’ve had enough.</p> <p><strong>Divorce is on the rise everywhere, isn’t it? </strong>No. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12011714/Divorce-rate-at-lowest-level-in-40-years-after-cohabitation-revolution.html\">According to new figures from the Office for National Statistics</a>, divorce overall decreased by 2.9% between 2012 and 2013.</p> <p><strong>Wow. </strong>In fact, it’s falling in every major demographic apart from the 50-plus group.</p> <p><strong>Just because of the kids? </strong>That’s part of it, certainly. But increasing longevity may also play a role: a lot of middle-aged couples today would rather call it quits than face another 20 or 30 years of loveless cohabitation.</p> <p><strong>Whereas in the old days they could just die, and avoid all that paperwork. </strong>Exactly.</p> <p><strong>This is all very depressing, but I guess it’s a good thing that more people are staying together for longer, if only to provide a a tense but stable environment for the children. </strong>Maybe. Some folks claim that in the long run, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/22/children-divorce-resolution-survey-rather-parents-separate\">a timely divorce is better for the kiddies than an unhappy marriage maintained for stability’s sake</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who claims that? </strong>Divorce lawyers.</p> <p><strong>Well, they would, wouldn’t they? </strong>Probably. According to a survey by the family lawyers’ group Resolution, eight out of 10 children of divorced parents believe a split is preferable to an intact but unhappy marriage.</p> <p><strong>Remind me how much a divorce costs again. </strong>Between £3,000 and £30,000, depending on how acrimonious. Much more if you’re rich.</p> <p><strong>In that case, I’d rather draw a line down the middle of the house and wait for death’s sweet release. </strong>That’s the spirit – stay positive.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Happy 21st, darling! Your father and I have some news.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “We’ve divided up the books and paintings amicably. If only there were some kind of professional arbiter who could help us separate the silver.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11011557","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2412827","internalRevision":"93","internalContentCode":"458428575","publication":"The

</strong>Preitenegg<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> At least 800 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Carinthian.</p> <p><strong>Full of noble fellows embodying the highest standards of amateur sportsmanship? </strong>Eh? No.</p> <p><strong>Full of buildings subscribing to the most ornate of the classical orders of architecture, characterised by flared capitals with rows of acanthus leaves? </strong>What? Oh, I see – no, not Corinthian. Carinthian.</p> <p><strong>Oh. What’s that then? </strong>Preitenegg is a small village of about 1,000 inhabitants in the Austrian state of Carinthia. It’s nestled in a very mountainous region of the upper Lavant Valley on the slopes of the Packalpe and the Koralpe.</p> <p><strong>Picturesque, sort of gingerbready, Sound of Music-y type place? </strong>If you squint a bit, yes.</p> <p><strong>Gasp! Are they remaking the Sound of Music? Is that why it’s in the news? I can see it now – Adele as Maria, David Tennant as the Captain, Peter Capaldi as the Germans, Cheryl Cole as Liesl and a special series of Britain’s Got Talent to find the rest of the Von Trapps. </strong>Alas, no.

Even if they’re on the M20 in England</a>.</p> <p><strong>That will soon make it less picturesque. </strong>So far, no one has actually gone. Most people being sent to an alpine village in Austria, when they are just trying to get to work and back somewhere in the UK, have twigged that there is a glitch in the system and refused to follow instructions.</p> <p><strong>That is evidence of an independent intelligence persisting in humans that a plethora of stories about people driving </strong><a href=\"http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/10753846.Sat_nav_leaves_Devizes_wedding_guests_stranded_in_a_field/?ref=rss\" title=\"\"><strong>across fields</strong></a><strong>, down cul-de-sacs and </strong><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/7362254.stm\" title=\"\"><strong>into rivers</strong></a><strong> because the robot voice told them to had almost destroyed.

But now they say it will be resolved with the next map update. Preitenegg can rest easy once again.</p> <p><strong>Until the Nazi hunters’ next sweep. </strong>I told you – shush. All a long time ago.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “The hills are alive with the sound of bewildered commuters.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Achtung,

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 15.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> <em>Gelyn holl Gymru</em>.</p> <p><strong>Did you just fall asleep on your keyboard?</strong> How incredibly racist of you. I was speaking Welsh.</p> <p><strong>Welsh? Since when has Welsh been a language?</strong> Since for ever, you dolt. I can’t believe this. First TripAdvisor doesn’t recognise Welsh, now the Guardian. It’s enough to drive you <em>hollol wyllt</em>.</p> <p><strong>TripAdvisor doesn’t recognise Welsh?</strong> Not even slightly. A Welsh tour guide is kicking off because <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3325050/TripAdvisor-sparks-outrage-refusing-run-review-s-written-WELSH.html#ixzz3s1bR5XFs\">TripAdvisor rejected his Welsh review</a>, on the basis that it violated the site’s language policy.</p> <p><strong>Really? What was he reviewing?</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.llyn-maritime-museum.co.uk/\">Llyn Maritime Museum</a>, a small attraction in a church in Nefyn.</p> <p><strong>And what did he think of it?</strong> We’ll never know. TripAdvisor rejected his review. However, <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g1097184-Activities-Nefyn_Gwynedd_North_Wales_Wales.html\">based on its English reviews</a>, the museum is the best attraction in Nefyn, ahead of a 19th-century watch tower and <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attractions-g1097184-Activities-Nefyn_Gwynedd_North_Wales_Wales.htm\">two transit vans</a> in a car park.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, I like transit vans.</strong> Listen, that’s not important. What’s important is that TripAdvisor is unwittingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/12/welsh-language-extinction-use\">marginalising a language spoken by more than half a million people</a>.</p> <p><strong>Is the tour guide annoyed?</strong> He is. Emrys Llewelyn called it an insult, <a href=\"http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/tripadvisor-refuses-publish-welsh-language-10456813\">saying</a>: “Welsh is a major language but TripAdvisor do not seem to think so. It’s difficult to keep a temper about something like this … TripAdvisor are making fools of themselves.”</p> <p><strong>Did he say all that in English?</strong> Well, yes, but that’s not the point. There are communities that would find Welsh-language reviews incredibly useful.</p> <p><strong>Communities who enjoy reading what someone with too much time on his hands thinks about a canoe in a church?</strong> Why not?</p> <p><strong>Then why don’t they just look at the museum’s website? That’s </strong><a href=\"http://www.llyn-maritime-museum.co.uk/\"><strong>in Welsh</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You’re not helping.</p> <p><strong>How has TripAdvisor countered this criticism?</strong> It says that, currently, it doesn’t have the capacity for Welsh-language moderation and fraud detection, so it’s better to reject all Welsh reviews outright than compromise the integrity of its site.</p> <p><strong>Still, at least this is good publicity for the museum.</strong> I know. It really looks quite nice.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “A global organisation such as TripAdvisor should be better at facilitating the needs of its own user base.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “<em>Does neb yn siarad Cymraeg beth bynnag</em>.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11000383","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-23T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2410940","internalRevision":"85","internalContentCode":"458414927","publication":"The

She spent a year in the 70s married to someone called Lord Colin Ivar Campbell, since when she’s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3322157/Why-Colin-Socialite-Lady-Campbell-confuses-m-Celebrity-viewers-MALE-title-kept-brief-failed-marriage-Scottish-aristocrat-40-years-ago.html\">continued to style herself “Lady” and call herself “Colin”</a>.</p> <p><strong>How innovative. Who doesn’t love a dotty aristocrat, eh? </strong>Tony Hadley. He and Lady Colin are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/gallery/2015/nov/11/im-a-celebrity-get-get-me-out-of-here-2015-welcome-the-jungles-new-contestants\">both currently appearing in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here</a>! and they’ve fallen out after he mistakenly nominated her as one of the laziest members of the camp. “I have five tiaras and I turned down one of the richest men on Earth,” she declared during her rebuttal.</p> <p><strong>I thought posh people were supposed to enjoy their tiaras quietly?</strong> We all are really, but Lady Colin isn’t too hung up on politeness. She is most famous for writing <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-507141/A-unlady-like-Lady-Why-high-society-terrified-Lady-Colin-Campbell.html\">Diana in Private</a>, the salacious book that first claimed Princess Diana had extramarital affairs and suffered from bulimia. Since then, in other books, she’s made some fairly wild claims about parentage in the royal family.</p> <p><strong>That sounds like a fun career. How did she get into it?</strong> She was born into a grand family in Jamaica and, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4709919/They-said-she-was-a-boy.html\">as a result of a genital defect, mistakenly raised as a boy called George until she was a teenager</a>. Following corrective surgery, she lived as Georgia instead, began modelling, married Lord Colin, had some high-society flings, worked in Harrods, and now owns the knackered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Goring\">Castle Goring in Sussex</a>. And she needs money.</p> <p><strong>The standard route then.</strong> Pretty much. It’s also given her a very unusual accent: part-Jamaican, part-posh-Scots. In the end, she sounds like Rastamouse pretending to be Irish.</p> <p><strong>I think I understand why the producers of I’m a Celebrity included her. </strong>“[I have been] roped in to be sport for the oiks,” Lady Colin says, which gets it about right.</p> <p><strong>But how will she cope with all those horrid, yucky things she will have to do?</strong> Really rather well, as it happens. For her first bushtucker trial she was required to eat live crickets, beach worms, a turkey testicle, camel lips and a pig’s eyeball, and demolished them gleefully with a knife and fork.</p> <p><strong>The benefits of boarding school, eh?</strong> Something like that.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>TV has a new superstar!</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> For a week.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10992571","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-19T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2409412","internalContentCode":"458403260","internalRevision":"97","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Born in Jamaica and mistakenly raised as a boy until 11, the Diana biographer is proving divisive in the I’m A Celebrity jungle.","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Who is Lady Colin Campbell and what is her accent?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-18T16:48:46Z","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e3a5b3150daf77e2036fca1a26b02ef66c4f5179/146_54_2827_1696/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"564c9213e4b0e98c91b0d55f","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-21T16:45:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Born in Jamaica and mistakenly raised as a boy until 11, the Diana biographer is proving divisive in the I’m A Celebrity jungle.</p>","linkText":"Who is Lady Colin Campbell and what is her accent?","creationDate":"2015-11-18T14:58:27Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-25T17:52:11.000Z","legallySensitive":"false"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/nov/18/who-is-lady-colin-campbell-and-why-does-she-sound-like-rastamouse-doing-an-irish-accent","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/nov/18/who-is-lady-colin-campbell-and-why-does-she-sound-like-rastamouse-doing-an-irish-accent","sectionName":"Television & radio","elements":[{"id":"e3a5b3150daf77e2036fca1a26b02ef66c4f5179","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/e3a5b3150daf77e2036fca1a26b02ef66c4f5179/146_54_2827_1696/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/e3a5b3150daf77e2036fca1a26b02ef66c4f5179","suppliersReference":"SHOWBIZ_Celebrity_152760.JPG","altText":"I’m A Celebrity ...

years, on average.</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Sandpiper.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Drab, mottled brown in the case of the female birds; brightly tufted heads, orange faces, black chests, and a large ruff of ornamental feathers in the case of most males.</p> <p><strong>Why only most males? </strong>Well, that’s the thing. Ruffs also have very elaborate gender politics.</p> <p><strong>Birds have gender politics? </strong>These ones do. Most male ruffs gather together each breeding season in great mass displays of their spectacular neck feathers and physical prowess. These gatherings are called leks, and the females enjoy looking around them, responding to the best males by bending over and presenting their genitals in a fairly unambiguous sign that they are willing to mate.</p> <p><strong>How heteronormative. </strong>I guess. Although among male ruffs there are other lifestyles. A small proportion of males don’t bother with spectacular plumage or engaging in displays, but instead wander around the lek looking for any females who, you know, happen to be bending over.</p> <p><strong>Um … </strong>And a third type of extremely rare male goes even further, thanks to an inverted section of its genome, which <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28493-ruff-bird-orgies-have-four-sexes-thanks-to-a-supergene-flip/?utm_source=NSNS&amp;utm_medium=SOC&amp;utm_campaign=twitter&amp;cmpid=SOC%7CNSNS%7C2015-GLOBAL-twitter\" title=\"\">has just been identified by scientists in Britain and Sweden</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh yes?</strong> Basically it looks just like a female, albeit a rather big one, and it too wanders around the lek looking for any real females that have made themselves available for mating. “The female bows down, and sometimes it’s a case of which male gets there first,” explains Terry Burke of the University of Sheffield, who led the British team behind the discovery. “It’s not necessarily a highly aggressive act.”</p> <p><strong>Well, that’s a relief.</strong> Nevertheless the cross-dressing males, known as “faeders”, also have <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3443.html\" title=\"\">unusually large testes</a>, probably to help them get the job done.</p> <p><strong>Yikes!</strong> What’s more, in all the confusion, the conventional-looking or “independent” males then often end up mounting the “faeders” while they in turn are mounting the females, in what a colleague of Burke’s calls “the sandwich”.</p> <p><strong>In the “confusion”, eh? </strong>That’s their story, and they’re sticking to it.</p> <p><strong>Do say: “</strong>No, I don’t want no ruffs. A ruff is a bird that can’t get no love from me.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Let’s talk about leks, baby.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10988576","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2408568","internalContentCode":"458396515","internalRevision":"62","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Scientists have discovered a breed of sandpiper with four different sexes.

top.</p> <p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Arsenal midfielder, saviour.</p> <p><strong>Saviour? You must be joking. He’s only played five matches so far this season. </strong>Not the saviour of Arsenal; the saviour of civilisation.</p> <p><strong>That makes more sense. Wait, no it doesn’t – what are you talking about? </strong>Flamini has <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/6742052/Mathieu-Flaminis-no-fuel.html\" title=\"\">just announced he has developed a breakthrough chemical process that could revolutionise the energy industry</a> and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.</p> <p><strong>I see. Are there perhaps two Mathieu Flaminis? </strong>No, it’s definitely the same one. He is a partner in an Italian company, GFBiochemicals, which claims to have found a new way to manufacture levulinic acid (LA).</p> <p><strong>Which is what, exactly? </strong>4-oxopentanoic acid, or CH3C(O)CH2CH2CO2H. It is an organic compound that could be used as a precursor to biofuels.</p> <p><strong>And Flamini makes this stuff? </strong>He has been funding research into it since his days with AC Milan, eventually starting a company with a partner, Pasquale Granata.</p> <p><strong>Where did their research take them? </strong>“After several months, we came up with the technology of how to produce LA on an industrial scale,” says Flamini. “We patented it.” The GFBiochemicals plant in Caserta now employs 80 people, synthesising LA from biomass waste.</p> <p><strong>It sounds as if this could be worth some money. </strong>“We are opening a new market,” says Flamini. “And it’s a market potentially worth £20bn.”</p> <p><strong>Wow! He’ll be able to retire. </strong>A lot of fans are suggesting he could use the money to buy Arsenal and fund the purchase of new players.</p> <p><strong>That’s a terrible idea. </strong>Because it overlooks Flamini’s obvious commitment to green issues and financing technological advances that could ultimately rescue our planet?</p> <p><strong>No, because I hate Arsenal. What does Wenger say about all this moonlighting?</strong> Apparently, he had no idea. “I don’t think Arsène Wenger knows, I never spoke to him about it,” says Flamini, who didn’t even tell family members about the investment until recently.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “While it remains to be seen whether levulinic acid can provide a cost-effective building block in biofuel manufacture, the compound has many applications in the pharmaceutical, plastics and solvent industries. Go on, my son!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I’m John Terry – welcome to my prototype nuclear fusion reactor.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10985981","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2407963","internalContentCode":"458389947","internalRevision":"51","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The French footballer has been moonlighting as a partner of a biochemical company that could revolutionise the energy industry – and net him £20bn.

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A piece of paper with writing on it.</p> <p><strong>You mean like this one?</strong> Yes. Unless you’re one of those people who reads this on the internet without paying.</p> <p><strong>Surely no one could be so dishonest?</strong> I’m afraid some people could, and you can never be sure which ones. That’s why prenups exist, in fact.</p> <p><strong>What are they?</strong> You know when you are in love and get married to someone?</p> <p><strong>Yeah.</strong> And you know when it all sours and you realise that they’re just lying, cheating filth and you end up living in a car park writing poems about how ugly their dog is?</p> <p><strong>Yeah.</strong> Well, prenups exist to manage that situation.</p> <p><strong>Do they poison my ex-partner? </strong>Not exactly. They specify in advance how the possessions of an engaged couple should be divided in the event of their divorce.</p> <p><strong>They get nothing, not even clothes or food. </strong>That would be an extreme example. Anyway, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-3315817/Bank-Mum-Dad-forces-grown-children-sign-pre-nups-don-t-lose-cash-relationship-breaks-down.html\" title=\"\">a newspaper has reported that the Law Society is getting an increasing number of inquiries about prenups</a>.</p> <p><strong>How come?</strong> I suppose they think that people want to read about it.</p> <p><strong>No, I mean how come more people want prenups?</strong> Apparently it’s being driven by the in-laws.</p> <p><strong>How so? </strong>Marrying couples often want to buy a house together but, in order to do so, they may well need a parent’s help to put down a deposit, probably amounting to tens of thousands of pounds. That parent wants to make sure their son- or daughter-in-law won’t walk off with half the money later, so they suggest that the couple sign a prenup specifying that their child would keep it all.</p> <p><strong>And that settles it?</strong> Heavens, no. British prenups aren’t legally binding or anything. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/27/pre-numpial-agreements-legally-binding-divorce-law-commission\" title=\"\">The Law Commission has recommended that they should become so</a>, as long as the couple and their children are properly looked after, but for now they just provide something for divorce courts to think about. There isn’t really an alternative.</p> <p><strong>Couldn’t you just prove that you really are “gaining a son/daughter” by accepting that they have the same rights to your money? </strong>Don’t be ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Do you take this man to be thy lawful wedded husband subject to the provisions in section 8 of the addendum attached herewith?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “My client does.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10978450","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2406878","internalContentCode":"458381068","internalRevision":"86","publication":"The
