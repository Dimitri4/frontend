No one [else] can be a Borges ... in terms of magic and scholarship I think he&apos;s inimitable.&quot; For Latin American writers, whether they liked him or not, he revolutionised the way language was used. &quot;Borges is one of the authors whom I most read – and whom I probably like the least,&quot; Gabriel García Márquez once said. &quot;I read Borges for his extraordinary ability at verbal artifice; he&apos;s a man who teaches you how to write ... to sharpen your instrument for saying things.&quot;</p> <p>In 1961 Borges won a major European award, the Prix Formentor, the success increasing his renown in his native Argentina as well as throughout Europe and the United States. He shared the prize with Samuel Beckett, with whom he represents, in Brian Dillon&apos;s words, the &quot;obscure conduit ... from modernism to postmodernism&quot;.</p> <p>As a result of this reputation, a reader who is new to Borges might expect forbidding prose, but nothing could be further from the truth. &quot;It is a quiet style,&quot; writes translator Andrew Hurley, &quot;whose effects are achieved not with bombast or pomp, but rather with a single exploding word or phrase, dropped almost as though offhandedly into a quiet sentence.&quot; He rarely used metaphors or similes; always chose the simplest, most accurate words; almost never wrote stories longer than 10 pages – and yet created some of the most unusual and complex fiction of the last century. How did he do it?</p> <p>Borges&apos;s stories agree with William Trevor&apos;s maxim that &quot;you don&apos;t have to have a plot in a short story, but you do have to have a point&quot;. In his foreword to Ronald Christ&apos;s 1969 study, The Narrow Act: Borges&apos; Art of Illusion, he quotes Shaw: &quot;The writer does not work from an idea but toward an idea.&quot; The best of his works, such as The Library of Babel (which first appeared in his 1941 collection, The Garden of Forking Paths) or Death and the Compass (1942), are inquiries into the nature of reality in which supposedly orderly forms – the library, the murder mystery – prove fundamentally unstable.</p> <p>This preoccupation can be seen as Borges&apos;s defining concern and is the meaning at the centre of the symbol he most frequently employs: the labyrinth. In the one hundred stories and aphorisms he wrote between 1935 and his death in Geneva in 1986, you&apos;re never far from one – whether it be an actual &quot;web of stone&quot;, a city&apos;s streets, or a tangle of guitar notes playing a milonga. As DL Shaw notes, labyrinths &quot;combine an appearance of design with an implied reality of futile chaos&quot;. Borges himself, in an interview with the Paris Review in 1967, hints at his own position when speaking about Kafka and Henry James: &quot;I think that they both thought of the world as being at the same time complex and meaningless.&quot;</p> <p>Many of Borges&apos;s works are hybrids – part-story and part-essay. They are so cunningly made that a friend of mine once tried ordering the book one story, The Approach to Al-Mu&apos;tasim (1936), purports to review. Although he felt no compunction about altering or misattributing his sources, many of the allusions with which Borges&apos;s work is crowded are to genuine texts – from Johnson to Carlyle to Schopenhauer, Stevenson, Quevedo, Cicero and the One Thousand and One Nights. He called himself &quot;a hedonistic reader&quot; with good reason.</p> <p>Such traits, alongside Borges&apos;s habit of including himself as a character in his fiction, stem from a conviction that literature, history, identity and time are infinitely mutable elements of the puzzle of existence. He believed, and memorably conveyed in Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote (1939), that &quot;every time a book is read or re-read ... something happens to the book&quot;. This is why Menard, who rewrites Cervantes&apos;s masterpiece word for word, is said to have written a &quot;more subtle&quot; book: time has modified the words&apos; associations, making the resulting work richer. Speaking elsewhere of Cervantes&apos;s poetry, Borges wrote that &quot;time – a friend to Cervantes – has corrected the proofs for him&quot;.</p> <p><em>Sui generis</em> stories such as this demonstrate Borges&apos;s true originality. Even genius bears influences, though. His are Poe, Kafka and, perhaps more surprisingly, Chesterton. Several of Borges&apos;s best stories take the form of detective fiction – a predilection best understood via Dorothy L Sayers&apos;s definition of the genre as &quot;a pure analytic exercise&quot;. As Ronald Christ writes, the detective story is &quot;quite formal and lucid without necessary commitment to its subject matter. And it is precisely this ability to focus on the argument or &apos;diagram&apos; behind the facts that Borges finds everywhere in Chesterton.&quot; The two greatest examples of Borges&apos;s work in this area are the aforementioned Death and the Compass and Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius (1940). The latter is a conspiracy theorist&apos;s dream.</p> <p>The investigative element of Borges&apos;s writing, which excites readers&apos; natural curiosity even as it withholds detective fiction&apos;s customary satisfactions, instils a tension in his work that is rare in experimental literature. And if such rewards as the unmasking of the killer or the solution to the riddle are absent, it isn&apos;t because of perversity but because uncertainty and error are central to the stories&apos; purpose. Borges, as David Gallagher writes, &quot;turned the genre into a potent metaphor of human frailty and ignorance&quot;. His adventurers never discover the centre of the labyrinth, only more forking paths.</p> <p><strong>Next:</strong> Vladimir Nabokov.</p>","wordcount":"943","commentCloseDate":"2010-07-29T10:12:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2010-07-22T09:06:25Z","internalComposerCode":"567aa686e4b0629150aaa16d","internalOctopusCode":"3616034","internalPageCode":"1429406","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2010-12-02T13:10:01Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2010-07-23T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/2tgkq","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/2tgkq"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2010/jul/22/short-story-jorge-luis-borges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jul/22/short-story-jorge-luis-borges","webTitle":"A brief survey of the short story part 27: Jorge Luis Borges","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-22T10:59:53Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","type":"article","id":"books/booksblog/2010/jul/22/short-story-jorge-luis-borges","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/867136","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"author/jorge-luis-borges","type":"author"},{"id":"bisac-prefix/FIC","type":"bisac-prefix"},{"id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[{"id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email","type":"rich-link"}]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[{"id":"bisac-prefix/FIC","type":"bisac-prefix"}]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jorgeluisborges","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Jorge Luis Borges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jorgeluisborges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jorgeluisborges","references":[{"id":"author/jorge-luis-borges","type":"author"}]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"fields":{"headline":"The world, by Jorge","standfirst":"He's one of the key storytellers of our century.

Jorge Luis Borges: Collected Fictions, translated by Andrew Hurley<br /> Penguin £20, pp550","trailText":"<p>Review: Collected Fictions (English translation)</p>","byline":"Alberto Manguel","main":"","body":"<p>The last time I saw him was in Paris, in the small hotel on the Rue des Beaux Arts that now carries plaques with the names of its two most celebrated guests: Oscar Wilde and Jorge Luis Borges. He was enjoying a period of travel to places he had always wanted to visit and now talked about them incessantly: to Egypt, where he had pocketed a handful of sand; to Iceland where, in a ruined church, he had recited &apos;Our Father&apos; in Anglo-Saxon; to Japan, where he had discussed Buddhism with a Shinto priest. He was once again writing short stories in the fantastic vein that he had made his own in Ficciones and The Aleph. </p> <p>Over dinner he told me the plot of the last fiction he was to write, &apos;Shakespeare&apos;s Memory&apos;, about a man who inherits the maze of Shakespeare&apos;s thoughts and recollections. It was never fully revised and should perhaps not have been published. In a brief poem written in the Fifties, he had observed that time doesn&apos;t like to reveal its endings: we don&apos;t know whose hand we&apos;ve shaken for the last time, or what door we have closed for all eternity. I didn&apos;t know that after that dinner we would never meet again. Borges died in Geneva on 28 June 1986. </p> <p>Vladimir Nabokov said that on first reading Borges he thought he had come upon a new and marvellous portico, but that behind the facade he found nothing. Poor Nabokov! What he took to be nothing is, in fact, everything or the possibility of everything: every story, every reflection, every thought and every event are all contained in what Borges called, in one of his best stories, the Library of Babel, the recipient of every book, past, present and future. What Borges offered his readers was a philosophy, an ethical system, a method (but these words are too mechanical) for the art of reading that is to say, for the craft of following a revelatory thread through the labyrinth of the universe. </p> <p>Borges&apos;s own readings were uniquely illuminating and original. They shone light on unexpected corners of the text, and his comments were original not because he was the first to make them, but because he was the first to remind us that such perceptions existed. Listening to him read (or rather, since he was as blind as Homer, listening to him comment on the texts that were read to him out loud by readers such as myself) was always a revelation. He insisted that his readings were rediscoveries, and quoted Bacon quoting Plato (unwittingly) quoting King Solomon to prove it: &apos;So that as Plato had an imagination, that all knowledge was but remembrance; so Solomon giveth his sentence, that all novelty is but oblivion.&apos; </p> <p>His acute observations colour the readings of even those who haven&apos;t read him, because they now form part of the way so many writers think and write, writers as diverse as Marguerite Yourcenar and Umberto Eco, Italo Calvino and George Steiner, Salman Rushdie and Northrop Frye. His clear intelligence led him to define the essential ambiguity at the heart of every work of art, thereby granting readers permission to enjoy and yet not fully understand: &apos;The imminence of a revelation that does not take place,&apos; he wrote, &apos;is, perhaps, the aesthetic fact.&apos; </p> <p>He observed that every writer creates his own precursors, thereby explaining the linked libraries that a soul-piercing book creates in the reader&apos;s memory. He told readers that they were, as much as himself, literary creators. He accepted the common feeling of bewildering unreality that at times pervades every reader and yet admitted the overwhelming knowledge that, despite it, our lives are horribly real (&apos;Time is a tiger that devours me, but I am that tiger,&apos; he admitted in &apos;A New Refutation of Time&apos;. &apos;Time is a fire that consumes me, but I am that fire. The world, alas, is real and I, alas, am Borges&apos;). </p> <p>He was a modest, profoundly ethical man who wished he could be braver and stronger, a man of action. He had no desire to be famous. He said that he longed for nothing but oblivion. He described in a short and extraordinary parable how Shakespeare, tired of being so many men, hoped to be nothing but one man, and how God, Shakespeare&apos;s Dreamer, mirrored his dream&apos;s despair in his own cosmic resignation. That mirroring was, for Borges, who hated mirrors, consolation of a kind. Above all, he believed, hope against hope, that it was our moral duty to be happy. </p> <p>Since the first American translations of Borges, attempted in the Fifties by well-intentioned admirers such as Donald Yates and James Irby, English-speaking readers have been very poorly served. From the uneven versions collected in Labyrinths to the more meticulous, but ultimately unsuccessful, editions published by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, from Ruth Simm&apos;s abominable apery of &apos;Other Inquisitions&apos; to Paul Bowles&apos;s illiterate rendition of &apos;The Circular Ruins&apos;, Borges in English must be read in spite of the translations. That one of the key writers of the century should lack an outstanding translator is indicative of how low &apos;foreign&apos; literature lies in the estimation of English-language publishers. English-language readers have either to resign themselves to the old, barely serviceable translations, or submit to the new, barely serviceable translations by Andrew Hurley, Professor of English at the University of Puerto Rico. </p> <p>Hurley has no ear for the rhythms of Borges&apos;s language. &apos;Funes el memorioso&apos; is for Hurley &apos;Funes, His Memory&apos; which is both inaccurate and ugly. &apos;Hombre de la Esquina Rosada&apos; becomes &apos;Man on Pink Corner&apos;, in inexplicable pidgin English. &apos;The Circular Ruins&apos;, whose perfect prose can be recited like a poem, begins felicitously in Hurley&apos;s rendition with &apos;No one saw him slip from the boat in the unanimous night&apos; and then sinks ignominiously with &apos;no one saw the bamboo canoe&apos; and its inappropriate rhyme. A number of stories have been decently translated and are as readable as the best among the earlier versions, but mere readability is not good enough. </p> <p>On what was to be our last night in Paris, Borges told me that, a few days earlier, he had attended a staging of Macbeth and that, in spite of the terrible performance, he had left the theatre &apos;shattered by tragic passion&apos;. &apos;How curious,&apos; he said, &apos;that Shakespeare&apos;s genius can even overcome the efforts of a bad actor.&apos; Borges&apos;s genius will overcome Hurley&apos;s version, as it has so many others, and English-speaking readers, while waiting for the inspired translator of Borges, may have to resign themselves to the not impossible task of learning Spanish. </p>","wordcount":"1105","commentable":"false","creationDate":"1999-10-27T08:49:34Z","internalComposerCode":"56927981e4b060a3548c37e5","internalOctopusCode":"867136","internalPageCode":"867136","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"1999-11-10T18:22:08Z","newspaperEditionDate":"1999-01-03T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/xhxd4","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/xhxd4"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/jan/03/fiction.jorgeluisborges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jan/03/fiction.jorgeluisborges","webTitle":"The world, by Jorge","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-03T18:22:08Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","type":"article","id":"books/1999/jan/03/fiction.jorgeluisborges","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/782171","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"author/jorge-luis-borges","type":"author"},{"id":"bisac-prefix/FIC","type":"bisac-prefix"},{"id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[],"tags":[{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[{"id":"bisac-prefix/FIC","type":"bisac-prefix"}]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[{"id":"rich-link/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email","type":"rich-link"}]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jorgeluisborges","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Jorge Luis Borges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jorgeluisborges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jorgeluisborges","references":[{"id":"author/jorge-luis-borges","type":"author"}]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]}],"fields":{"headline":"Blind genius of faction","standfirst":"Obituary of Jorge Luis Borges, Argentine writer","trailText":"<p>Obituary: Jorge Luis Borges\n</p>","byline":"WJ Weatherby","main":"","body":"<p>Jorge Luis Borges, one of Latin America&apos;s greatest writers, was a master at combining fact and fiction. His greatest works, written before he became totally blind in the mid-1950s combine the short story and essay forms to produce fables as convincing as if they were reportage from some spiritual daily newspaper. </p> <p>It delighted him to profile an imaginary writer or review a book that had never been written in a way that had readers convinced they were real. A master of paradox, he credited G. K. Chesterton, the lover of paradox, as being a major influence. One personal paradox was that although he was blind, he was one of the most widely read of creative writers and had a special love for English literature. The Falklands war between his country and Britain was a great tragedy to him and the only word this master of precision could find for it was &apos;atrocious. &apos; </p> <p>He died of liver cancer at 86 in Geneva, where he had gone to school in his teens. He remained active as a writer until close to the end, but writing more poetry than prose because he said it was easier to memorise and dictate since his blindness became complete. </p> <p>Blindness ran in his family and as far back as 1927 he had to have a series of operations on his eyes. The direction his writing took was strongly influenced by this great handicap because he avoided long works like novels and concentrated on brief fables and essays and imaginary bestiaries that did not require so much eye work. </p> <p>It also seemed to stimulate his imagination, so that his later works written in darkness were largely dreamlike flights based on transforming his memories of reality or his scholarly interests with a great number of invented cross references to people and books that did not exist. </p> <p>Labyrinths, Ficciones and The Aleph and Other Stories, published in English translation when he was 60, were probably his most original works and brought him international recognition. He shared the Fomnentor Prize with Samuel Beckett in 1961 and was several times on the short-list for the Nobel Prize. He never won it, allegedly because he took little active part in politics even during the Peron years of dictatorship in Argentina. </p> <p>His blindness restricted his public appearances, but even though his work as a librarian and teacher did not give him much of a platform, he made very clear his dislike of any political leaders who offended his definition of civilised behaviour. </p> <p>To meet this tall, modest man leaning on a stick, was to experience old-world courtesy at its best and a mind that seemed to have gained some extra quality of clarity and understanding to compensate for his blindness. He saw through life&apos;s mysteries in his fables more clearly than most of his contemporaries, and showed that a love of language can have a passion almost as deep as sexual feelings. </p> <p>His critics, such as Vladimir Nabokov, claimed he delighted in creating literary labyrinths for their own sake - &apos;The Book of Imaginary Beings&apos; (1969) was an example usually quoted by them - but this criticism was to miss the leaning of the labyrinth as his lifetime metaphor. The labyrinth represented his blindness and his works were his way out of the despair that always threatened to overcome a great, courageous, and wise man.</p>","wordcount":"562","commentable":"false","creationDate":"1999-10-29T16:58:46Z","internalComposerCode":"569c5605e4b0adb6347aef7d","internalOctopusCode":"782171","internalPageCode":"782171","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"1999-11-10T18:22:50Z","newspaperEditionDate":"1986-06-16T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/xcjp8","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"1","internalShortId":"/p/xcjp8"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1986/jun/16/fiction.jorgeluisborges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1986/jun/16/fiction.jorgeluisborges","webTitle":"Blind genius of faction","webPublicationDate":"1986-06-16T17:22:50Z","sectionName":"Books","sectionId":"books","type":"article","id":"books/1986/jun/16/fiction.jorgeluisborges","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","editions":[{"id":"books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":"Google doodle celebrates master of magical realism ","lastModified":"2011-08-23T23:00:00Z"}]}}
