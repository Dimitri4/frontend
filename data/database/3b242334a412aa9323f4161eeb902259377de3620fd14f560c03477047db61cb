He pauses for effect. “Only because the other two aren’t open today.”</p> <p>“Cup of tea?” smiles Carl Johnson, the proprietor. “Arsenic with that?”</p> <p>There’s high-quality banter and cheap teas – 50p for regulars – <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g315939-d4427141-Reviews-Carlsburger-Thetford_Norfolk_East_Anglia_England.html\" title=\"\">at Carlsburger</a> but according to research by RAC Truck Rescue, more than four in 10 HGV drivers now crave healthier, low-fat or sugar-free food – salads and falafels – when on the road. The lack of healthy-eating options is one of the biggest frustrations facing lorry drivers, who are more health-conscious than sales reps and company-car drivers.</p> <p>“There’s a lack of decent meals. You’ve just got to look at HGV drivers, half of them are overweight,” says Darren, a truck driver who has pulled over for a bacon-and-double-egg roll. “You get fed up of it. Chips with everything. That’s not what you want every day, seven days a week. You want a change – home-cooked food. A shepherd’s pie, something with vegetables for a change instead of chips. But these guys aren’t going to stand here doing a roast dinner.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53de01b3da405a36c1cd5031bf895070ea8191ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53de01b3da405a36c1cd5031bf895070ea8191ea/0_109_1760_1056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlsburger’s Carl Johnson with a customer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlsburger’s Carl Johnson with a customer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Darren is not overweight: how does he keep slim? “I miss my lunch and go through to tea,” he says.</p> <p>“I hope you’ve noticed the eggs have gone on without any fat,” says Johnson as he cooks Darren’s lunch. “We never fry, we never put any extra fat on, we lightly butter the rolls. My brother is a personal trainer, so I’m keen to keep as healthy as possible.”</p> <p>After Darren, however, the next customer is served a special cheese, onion, tomato and lettuce roll – a healthier item not currently listed on Carlsburger’s hot menu.</p> <p>“I had a heart scare four weeks ago, I’ve got three blocked arteries and I’m waiting for an operation, so I’ve had to change my diet,” says Colin Thorogood. “The surgeons are trying to mend me so the least I can do is meet them halfway.”</p> <p>Like many other HGV drivers, Darren’s beef is not with good-value roadside cafes such as Carlsburger, but with overpriced motorway service areas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/02/industrial-failure-uk-lorry-trade-truck-driver-squalor-low-pay-no-unions\">A mirror vision of industrial failure – the UK lorry trade | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s probably not enough choice at the moment,” says Chris Rampley of the Road Haulage Association. “The majority of the big three – Moto, RoadChef and Welcome Break – tend to have franchise deals so you’ve got your McDonald’s, Burger King, fast-food outlets. Some drivers like that but the choice is not as great as it could be.”</p> <p>Haulier Eddie Stobart provides its drivers with subsidised cafes in many of its 50 depots across the country. “You can have your bacon-and-egg sandwiches but there’s a range of healthier options – salads and omelettes,” says Eddie Stobart spokesperson James Andrew. “My favourite is the tomato and mushroom omelette.”</p> <p>The RAC research follows a report by the travel watchdog <a href=\"http://www.transportfocus.org.uk/about/\" title=\"\">Transport Focus</a> which found that the basic needs of truck drivers are not being met, in terms of healthy food and a lack of HGV parking and toilets. The group is calling for the government and Highways England to improve roadside facilities, particularly on A roads.</p> <p>“Generally, there isn’t any choice,” says Darren. “If you go down to the service station, you end up spending a fortune. We want quick food and these [roadside vans] are ideal for us.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"579","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T15:39:35Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T14:48:59Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T15:39:35Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9ed5be4b0f5d064841d52","internalOctopusCode":"11794519","internalPageCode":"2642529","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-10T16:13:17Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q6nc","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/319621a0b8b8b3eef950509913158e78f2379f6e/6_542_6601_3961/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"74","internalShortId":"/p/4q6nc"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/09/why-truck-drivers-are-sick-of-chips-with-everything","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/09/why-truck-drivers-are-sick-of-chips-with-everything","webTitle":"Why truck drivers are sick of ‘chips with everything’ ","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T15:39:35Z","sectionName":"Life and style","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/09/why-truck-drivers-are-sick-of-chips-with-everything","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle","editions":[{"id":"lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle","code":"default"},{"id":"au/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/lifeandstyle","code":"au"},{"id":"uk/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/lifeandstyle","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/lifeandstyle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/lifeandstyle","code":"us"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
