my teens I was too afraid to experiment. Maybe it’s a measure of the society where I grew up (in Mumbai), where compliance to the larger system was demanded as the route to success; success itself being defined in terms of material possessions. And failure frowned upon. Or perhaps it was just me. I never could let myself take the leap and just try things for fun, without worrying about the outcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/03/ya-dystopian-novel-india-south-asia-laxmi-hariharan\">Why the hero of my YA dystopian novel had to be an angry young Indian girl</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is my writing that made me realise that it was important to try new things without worrying about the results; for only then could I differentiate my “true” feelings, from the ones I’d been told I “should” have. Only then could I get more “real” in what I write. And it is this very “non-fear” of experimenting, the “non-judgment” of outcomes, which attracts me to speculative fiction (sometimes shortened to spec-fic). </p> <p>I write fantastical, action-adventure. Thrillers, which are sometimes magic realist, and which sometimes borrow from Indian mythology. Oh! And my young heroes are often of Indian origin. So yeah! My brand of YA is not easily classifiable. Imagine my relief when I found I had a home in speculative YA. There are less rules here, so I don’t worry so much about breaking them.</p> <p>So, then, I wanted to understand what YA speculative fiction really meant in today’s world. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/12/ten-must-read-ya-novels-youve-probably-never-heard-of\">Ten must-read YA novels you've probably never heard of</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rysa Walker, author of the <a href=\"http://rysa.com/\">Chronos Files</a> YA series told me, “Anything that couldn’t happen in real life is speculative fiction.”</p> <p>Speculative fiction is, as I found, an umbrella term for fantasy, science fiction, horror, magic realism; everything that falls under “that which can’t really happen or hasn’t happened yet.”</p> <p> A great example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom_(book_series)\">The Old Kingdom</a> series, by Garth Nix. It’s a story about the daughter of a family of necromancers, who lives on the cusp of a world with technology and a world with magic, where one doesn’t work in the realm of others, can definitely be placed in the speculative fiction genre.</p> <p>One of my all time speculative YA favourites is Scott Westerfield’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/uglies.html\">Uglies</a>. Set in a post scarcity dystopian future in which everyone is turned “Pretty” by extreme cosmetic surgery when they turn 16 years-old.</p> <p>Nicole Ciacchella, author of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Contributor-Trilogy-book-1-ebook/dp/B0096DIPI6\">Contributor Trilogy</a><em>,</em> told me: “YA speculative fiction allows its young characters to play the starring role in the narrative. Since it centres around ‘what if\\ questions — What if there were magic in the world? What if the government threw a bunch of teenagers into an arena and made them fight to the death? — it lends itself very well to placing young protagonists front and centre. Plus, it’s no coincidence that the teens in these stories are often acting in defiance of the adult characters.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4b13c119de046eb8181a9230044bb0ee42ef0d57\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/24/1448360968089/b034a479-ce78-4e60-9d29-9b9f42024a18-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Sabriel\" width=\"198\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But it’s more than that isn’t it?

This amazing book is a perfect read for anyone and I would recommend it to everyone.

begins, my goddaughter, Blue, has already been up and down a slide eight times. She has also crawled through a cave, created her own puppet show and run wild in the playground outside. The Discover Centre has two play spaces – the Story Trail inside and the Story Garden outside – and they’re worth the price of admission alone. It’s like clambering inside a kid’s head just when their imagination is firing. After all this multisensory, multicoloured mayhem, the show itself is a tad disappointing. </p> <p>The set, which has been designed by the Discover team, is undoubtedly gorgeous and impressively faithful to <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/cr-100025/nick-butterworth\">Nick Butterworth’s original illustrations</a>. Green glass glistens, a wood hut is nestled in the corner and a great oak tree climbs up the centre: it’s as if someone has lovingly nudged the pictures on to the stage. You can almost hear the young children sigh with happiness as they’re ushered into this cosy and familiar space. </p> <p>The show is based on the picture book After the Storm, in which Percy has to find new homes for the animals after his park is damaged in a gale. Oddly, Percy himself never appears. Instead, Percy’s assistant, Mike (Daniel Naddafy), guides us through the story. Naddafy is a calming onstage presence, but it’s a bit of a nothing role, especially compared with the book’s kind and twinkly Percy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86ab16289c1c6f1e495eb3b47ae581e68a167fb3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/86ab16289c1c6f1e495eb3b47ae581e68a167fb3/0_157_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The puppets are the stars … in Percy the Park Keeper’s Winter Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The puppets are the stars … in Percy the Park Keeper’s Winter Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children are sat on a “lawn” in front of the stage and the adults are perched behind. When the children are engaged, they shuffle forward. When they’re a little lost, they edge back towards their parents. Perhaps they’re all too pumped after the playground but they take a long time to settle. At one point, a curious child ventures too close to the stage and an usher intervenes. This might be labelled an “interactive” show, but the interaction is strictly monitored. </p> <p>As is so often the case, it’s the puppets that reel in the kids. A patchwork fox, fluffy squirrel, dozy badger, duck, rabbits, moles and mice all scamper across the stage. The children edge closer and quickly pick their favourites. One child becomes so attached to the mole that she beams and waves at it for a good few minutes. </p> <p>Once the repairs have been made, the new animals’ homes are revealed: a grand perch for the owl, a snazzy swing for the rabbits and a snug little space, complete with nuts, for the squirrel. For a few precious minutes, the stage feels like home. It’s a charming and cheering final sequence, which taps into the nostalgic comfort that Butterworth’s books provide. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.discover.org.uk/whatson/event/percy-the-park-keepers-winter-park\">Discover Children’s Story Centre</a>, London, until 23 December.

Thanks a lot, he thought.”</p> <p>Rushdie describes the ban as a “painful blow” in Joseph Anton, saying that “out of that pain” he wrote an open letter to Rajiv Gandhi. “This is no way, Mr Gandhi, for a free society to behave,” he wrote. “What sort of India do you wish to govern? Is it to be an open or a repressive society? Your action in the matter of The Satanic Verses will be an important indicator for many people around the world.”</p> <p>In the memoir, which is written in the third person, Rushdie writes that he was “defending a thing he revered above most things, the art of literature, against a piece of blatant political opportunism”. The letter ended: “You own the present, Mr Prime Minister; but the centuries belong to art.”</p> <p>The day after the letter was published, Rushdie’s publishers, Viking, received their first death threat. In February 1989, Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini called for Rushdie’s death as he issued a fatwa against him. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/20/salman-rushdie-jaipur-literary-festival\">Rushdie was forced to pull out of attending a literary festival in Jaipur</a> over threats of violence, and in 2013, his planned visit to Kolkata to promote the film of his novel Midnight’s Children was cancelled, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-21289355\">the author saying at the time</a> that “the day before I was due to travel to Kolkata we were informed that the Kolkata police would refuse to allow me to enter the city. If I flew there, I was told, I would be put on the next plane back. I was also told that this was at the request of the chief minister.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/04/two-years-eight-months-and-twenty-eight-nights-salman-rushdie-review\">Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty‑Eight Nights by Salman Rushdie review – a modern Arabian Nights  </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rushdie reacted to news that Obama had had bought <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/323717/s/two-years-eight-months-and-twenty-eight-nights/\">Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights</a>, during his outing to independent bookshop Upshur Street Books in Washington DC, in robust form. </p> <p>Responding to a Twitter comment that the purchase was Obama “thumb[ing] his nose at Ayatollah Khamene’i by very publicly buying @SalmanRushdie’s latest”, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalmanRushdie/status/670711700195254272\">Rushdie asked</a>: “Would it be wrong to think that there might be a reason for buying my book that is not related to Khomeini?”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/28/obamas-bookstore-haul-a-franzen-a-rushdie-and-a-wimpy-kid/\">The New York Times reported</a> that the US president also took the opportunity of his Small Business Saturday outing to buy Jonathan Franzen’s Purity, three young adult titles by Cynthia Voight, and Jeff Kinney’s eighth Wimpy Kid title, Hard Luck.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Former minister P Chidambaram tells audience he has ‘no hesitation’ in saying ban on Rushdie’s controversial novel was wrong – but 27-year embargo stands","headline":"Banning Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses was 'wrong' says Indian minister","byline":"Alison Flood","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9bd8451b4745911306c5b76a83dd2e0736b2279/0_42_3000_1797/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-12-07T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Former minister P Chidambaram tells audience he has ‘no hesitation’ in saying ban on Rushdie’s controversial novel was wrong – but 27-year embargo stands</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/01/banning-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses-was-wrong-says-indian-minister","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/dec/01/banning-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses-was-wrong-says-indian-minister","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d9bd8451b4745911306c5b76a83dd2e0736b2279","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9bd8451b4745911306c5b76a83dd2e0736b2279/0_42_3000_1797/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"2013 Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert","picdarUrn":"GD*37604527","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/d9bd8451b4745911306c5b76a83dd2e0736b2279","suppliersReference":"176222884","altText":"India’s ban still stands, despite the apology … Salman Rushdie.

sumptuously designed debut picture book about loss as their book of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\"

href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/316571/s/the-fox-and-the-star/\">The Fox and the Star</a> beat a shortlist that included Lee’s second novel and Hawkins’ thriller to be named book of the year by the UK’s largest bookselling chain. Managing director James Daunt called it “a book of great physical beauty and timeless quality, one that will surely join that very special group of classic tales that appeal equally to children and adults”. It won the bookseller’s top accolade ahead of contenders including Elena Ferrante’s much-praised My Brilliant Friend and Hanya Yanagihara’s Booker-shortlisted A Little Life “through the impassioned advocacy of our outstanding children’s booksellers,” added Daunt.</p> <p>The title will now receive “the full and committed backing” of Waterstones throughout December. Last year, sales of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/29/the-miniaturist-jessie-burton-review\">Jessie Burton’s novel The Miniaturist</a> increased by over 1,000% across Waterstones after it was named book of the year. Previous winners of the honour include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/stoner-john-williams-julian-barnes\">Stoner by John Williams</a>.</p> <p>Bickford-Smith is a designer at Penguin Books, acclaimed for her work on Penguin Classics, but has “wanted to tell a story” herself since she was “very, very young”. Offered a book deal by Penguin’s Particular Books, she took a six-month sabbatical from a company where she has worked for 14 years to write and illustrate The Fox and the Star.</p> <p>Inspired by William Blake’s poem Eternity – “He who binds to himself a joy / Does the winged life destroy; / But he who kisses the joy as it flies / Lives in eternity’s sun rise” – it tells of the forest-dwelling Fox, who loses, and mourns for, his friend Star.</p> <p>“I had this idea buzzing at the back of my mind,” said Bickford-Smith. “And then, with the illustrations, I got to step away from my computer, and to draw and draw and draw, which as a child was all I ever did. Facing the blank page every day was really petrifying, and then things just happened.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d6558f696bdc23305db73347c29ef891e6c55f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/32d6558f696bdc23305db73347c29ef891e6c55f/0_0_4182_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Fox and the Star\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A book of great physical beauty’: illustrations from The Fox and the Star.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Coralie Bickford-Smith/Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Waterstones said the picture book “has the classic feel of a fable and is a tale that speaks to all ages”, praising its “unparalleled, elegant design” and its “profound psychological understanding of loss”.</p> <p>“I was thinking about how in life, if you hold on to something too tightly, you lose it, so to love something you have to let it go, and I wrote the story around that. It relates to so many situations – everyone has suffered – and it came together for me with losing my mum at an early age,” said Bickford-Smith. “Children seem to love the idea of the friends and the crazy illustrations, while adults like the concept of things being tough, but coming out the other side.”</p> <p>Waterstones comes up with a shortlist after asking its booksellers to nominate a book “that stands out in its field and speaks to the company’s core customers – those people who love reading and love books”. The bookseller has said that it is set to announce its first annual profit in years, noting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/20/waterstones-profit-books-amazon\">a surge in physical sales, as digital sales stall</a>.</p> <p>“I’m all about the physical book,” said Bickford-Smith. “We haven’t released The Fox and the Star as an ebook because I don’t think it would work – it’s all about the paper. I wanted to create something which harked back to the beautiful visual thinking of William Morris and William Blake, so that people would really appreciate the book as an object.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Inspired by the poetry of Blake, Bickford-Smith’s picture-book fable about grief is awarded top prize for its ‘great

Did Hélène and Anatole Kuragin really get it on like <a href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Incest\">Cersei and Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones</a>? No, argues <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/12023569/BBC-under-fire-for-ripe-and-inappropriate-adaptation-of-War-and-Peace.html\">Tolstoy scholar Andrew Kaufman</a>: “That has absolutely no justification in the text. It just doesn’t exist in it. I think they may be imposing a 21st-century perspective on to a 19th-century novel.”</p> <p>Yes, argues Andrew Davies, who decided to put Hélène and Anatole in bed together in his adaptation, which will be broadcast in January.</p> <p>Who’s right? Well, on page 238 of the Penguin edition, Pierre Bezukhov is musing about Hélène, whom he will later and disastrously marry. He asks himself: “Didn’t I hear that her own brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, that there were was a regular scandal and that was the reason he was sent away?” But the book includes no sex scene to clinch those rumours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dd322282f7e91bde848e5a12871132526e28537\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4dd322282f7e91bde848e5a12871132526e28537/0_0_2402_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in Andrew Davies’s 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sexed up: Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in Andrew Davies’s 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Photo Library/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Davies, a successful and sought-after TV adapter of great novels, has previous in sexing up the classics. You’ll look in vain in Austen’s Pride and Prejudice for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hasKmDr1yrA\">the scene Davies wrote for the 1995 BBC adaptation in which Mr Darcy emerges from his lake</a>, shirt clinging to his embonpoint, making Elizabeth Bennet come over all unnecessary on Pemberley’s terrace. Nor will you find reference to a lecherous bulldog in Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago to justify Davies’s scene in his 2002 adaptation. “In the scene I’ve written he’s excited by the sounds and smells of sex coming from the other side of the door,” Davies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/oct/02/broadcasting.arts\">said at the time</a>. “Then I wrote this stage direction that the dog should turn round and look at Lara with this lecherous grin.” Pity the casting director: how many bulldogs can perform lecherous grins on demand?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a6539c781cbf13c0e4d919f3d9a21d29cf9ab2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/08a6539c781cbf13c0e4d919f3d9a21d29cf9ab2/0_164_2983_1788/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aidan Turner’s Ross Poldark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Handy with a scythe: Aidan Turner’s Ross Poldark</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the introduction of a lecherously grinning dog didn’t cause the most upset over Davies’ adaptation of Doctor Zhivago. The Pasternak family was also unhappy because, as is the case with his treatment of War and Peace, Davies included a sex scene only alluded to in the novel – featuring Zhivago’s rival, Kormarovsky, played by Sam Neil, and the heroine Lara, played by Keira Knightley. </p> <p>However in all the above cases, it can be argued that Davies was faithful to the spirit, if not letters, of the novels. Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11550044/Poldarks-meadow-mowing-just-doesnt-cut-it-scything-community-says.html\">the scything community may have seethed at how Aidan Turner’s Ross Poldark mowed a hay field half naked</a> earlier this year, but that doesn’t mean the BBC adaptation misrepresented the character’s hunky aura in Winston Graham’s books. Equally, there may have been no muppets in Dickens, but that doesn’t mean Kermit and Missy Piggy as Bob and Emily Cratchit jettisoned A Christmas Carol’s emotional essence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e2c6646307192c91deef268d56f1e3a8e675a72\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1e2c6646307192c91deef268d56f1e3a8e675a72/0_160_2528_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kermit and Miss Piggy in The Muppet Christmas Carol\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kermit and Miss Piggy in The Muppet Christmas Carol: capture A Christmas Carol’s emotional essence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That’s not true of this year’s TV adaption of JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, where screenwriter Sarah Phelps spared Robbie Weedon (spoiler alert!) the death by drowning he suffers in the book. To be fair, Phelps told Rowling she was going to change the story in adapting it for the screen and the novelist tweeted her approval after it was screened, but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11443981/J-K-Rowling-left-crying-her-eyes-out-at-BBCs-new-Casual-Vacancy-ending.html\">some fans of the book felt betrayed</a>. For clear-cut betrayal, though, think of what Hitchcock did to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031505/\">Jamaica Inn</a>. Daphne du Maurier hated his 1939 film of her 1936 novel and she may have had a point: Hitchcock erased much of what made the spirited Mary Yellan so adorable and instead unaccountably boosted the story of the comeuppance of Charles Laughton’s evil Sir Humphrey Pengallan. It wasn’t so much an adaptation as a right old savaging.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/stephen-king-justified-hating-kubricks-vision-shin-226309\">Stephen King thought Stanley Kubrick had done something similar</a> when he adapted The Shining. The novel’s great theme was how anybody can become evil, but this was lost, he thought, thanks to Kubrick’s chilly directing style and Jack Nicholson’s clamorously manic, gurning performance. King felt so betrayed by the adaptation that he made a poorly regarded 1997 miniseries to set the record straight. Tolstoy, even if he is turning in his grave right now, doesn’t have that option.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcafbb7c06ee4d5ccf49ff5c35a99385aabb346e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dcafbb7c06ee4d5ccf49ff5c35a99385aabb346e/0_34_2549_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Laughton as Sir Humphrey Pengallan in Hitchcock’s Jamaica Inn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clear-cut betrayal: Charles Laughton as Sir Humphrey Pengallan in Hitchcock’s Jamaica Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Screenwriter Andrew Davies has included incestuous sex scenes in his BBC adaptation of War and Peace.

Can the sculptors gentrify Afghanistan?","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-30T18:40:40Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1053","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4eg23","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/scott_king.htm?section_name=new_britannia\">Scott King</a> is nervous. He was nervous back in 2014, when his miniature graphic novel, <a href=\"http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_p=6&amp;id_b=2597\">Anish and Antony Take Afghanistan</a>, was exhibited in New York – entirely by coincidence – on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/america-9-11-anniversary-ceremonies\">anniversary of 9/11</a>. The problem is that the book ends in an orgy of terrorist violence – a swarm of passenger planes crashing into buildings. He’s nervous today because the same work is being shown in London, and again the timing is bad. After all, he tells me, he’s not really making a point about foreign policy, or even terrorism.</p> <p>You could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. The magazine art director turned artist has created a strip, illustrated in Victor magazine style by <a href=\"http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/scott-king-anish-and-antony-take-afghanistan\">Will Henry</a>, which tells the story of Anish Kapoor and Antony Gormley “regenerating” Afghanistan through monumental art. It is a hallucinatory romp in which the country’s turbo-gentrification comes before a devastating fall. But this is a parable, King tells me, and a copy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal\">Swift’s A Modest Proposal</a> on his desk hints at the tradition he’s working in. The story is less about Helmand than Hartlepool.</p> <p>“Lots of people immediately read Afghanistan as a metaphor for the north-east and how New Labour attempted to regenerate through totemic sculpture,” he says. King, originally from Goole in east Yorkshire, wanted to point out how absurd it was that, “in areas that have been wilfully run down and had their industry removed”, the solution could be gargantuan art. Think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/feb/13/happybirthdayangeloftheno\">Gormley’s Angel of the North</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/jun/10/anish-kapoor-sculpture-temenos-art\">Temenos, Kapoor</a>’s 110m-long slinky spring, which straddles Middlesbrough dock. In King’s work, both men come off as preposterous narcissists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86e018d1949d091046e15ff64737a72ae63f4d57\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/86e018d1949d091046e15ff64737a72ae63f4d57/40_363_877_1040/843.jpg\" alt=\"The artist Scott King\" width=\"843\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘My complaint is that there is a degree of arrogance and disconnectedness to what [Kapoor and Gormley] are doing’ … Scott King</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I don’t hate them,” he insists. “You might say I was jealous of them, but I’m not. I’m really not. My complaint is that there is a degree of arrogance and disconnectedness to what they’re doing.” Gormley’s sculptures are based on his own body, although the aim is to conjure up a sort of contemporary everyman. King concedes this, but says if you strip that explanation away, “This is a 65ft-tall version of himself with wings. Similarly, his proposal for the Olympic site was a 390ft-tall statue of himself. This is what dictators do. They build 400ft statues of themselves.”</p> <p>King doesn’t like the word satire – he says it suggests “a kind of temporary pin-pricking” – but much of his work has been about cleverly taking the piss out of art and pop culture. Which is maybe why it’s a surprise to find that, in person, he’s down to earth, warm, and endearingly unsure of himself. He’s represented by the buzzy <a href=\"http://www.heraldst.com/\">East End gallery Herald St</a>, in London, and by <a href=\"http://bortolamigallery.com/artist/scott-king//works/\">Bortolami in New York</a>, but tells me “I’ve done some crap work”. And although he was art director of <a href=\"http://i-d.vice.com/en_gb\">I-D</a> at only 24, producing covers with Kate Moss, Björk and Drew Barrymore, he doesn’t have the air of an arbiter of cool.</p> <p>We sit in a small room in his house, sipping milky tea amid stacks of books about art, old records and scribbled Post-it notes. He is a strong physical presence, but not intimidating: stubbled, wearing T-shirt and jeans. Someone you might see reading in a quiet corner of your local. He says he never entirely bought into the dizzy world of parties and openings. “I look back 20 years and think I was an idiot because I used to go to the pub with my notebook, scribbling Joy Division misery.” He has the words Love Will Tear Us Apart tattooed on his right arm.</p> <p>“I was in a privileged position as art director … you get into gigs for free, you don’t queue any more. I certainly didn’t exploit it in the way I could have.” He yearned to be a “real” artist. “I used to look at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/apr/30/yba-25-years-damien-hirst\">YBAs</a> and think that looks so much better than sticking down photocopies of pictures of Kylie or whatever.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a60b1b6817bbd13e5f8d3711c796f4b593152071\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a60b1b6817bbd13e5f8d3711c796f4b593152071/0_76_595_766/388.jpg\" alt=\"A frame from Anish and Antony Take Afghanistan by Scott KIng, with illustrations by Will Henry.\" width=\"388\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A frame from Anish and Antony Take Afghanistan by Scott King, with illustrations by Will Henry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: courtesy the artist and Herald St, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He didn’t have to wait too long. He recalls the night of his 30th birthday in 1999, basking in the glory of curating a show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. “Where I’m from, coming to that! I remember going into the ICA bookshop having come to London to sign on and not being able to afford a book – [from that] to actually having a show.”</p> <p>His particular combination of media savvy and art-world cachet attracted the attention of the Pet Shop Boys and Morrissey, for both of whom he has designed record sleeves. I almost get the impression he’s more comfortable in the world of music than art. He released a single in 2013 called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thevinylfactory/scott-king-youre-my-favourite\">You’re My Favourite Artist</a>, a funny and dancable satire on fandom. The likes of Mumford &amp; Sons get both barrels – he once told an interviewer that the band “represent everything that is wrong with this country today”. Now he remarks that Adele is “ruining our lives” with her brand of “dreadful pub karaoke”.</p> <p>Despite King’s relative success, this still feels like punching up. At 46, he occupies an odd place in the art world. He’s neither blue chip like Kapoor and Gormley, nor Turner fodder like his friend Jeremy Deller, nor the latest hip young thing – a status he reckons the art industry sets far too much store by. He laments the lack of support for artists in the middle of their careers, of medium status. There’s also the “baggage” of what he calls “this design thing” that includes <a href=\"http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/scott_king_articles.htm\">Cher Guevara</a>, a poster he created to give away free to students, and which, 15 years on, refuses to die. “It’s something I regret deeply,” he says, but adds: “It was a good thing, it was quite funny.”</p> <p>It’s this tension between self-belief and regret, and his sense of himself as an eternal outsider, that makes King appealing, despite his stinging critiques. He is a walking antidote to the artist-as-saviour. And if he ever does get that big public sculpture commission, we can be sure it won’t be tall, and it won’t be him.</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.heraldst.com/anish-and-antony\">Anish and Antony Take Afghanistan</a> by Scott King, with illustrations by Will Henry, is at Herald St –Golden Square, London W1, until 12 December.

The antique machine – incidentally, the same model preferred by the writer Will Self – is stylish and durable, less of a prop than a symbol of an insurgency aided and abetted by Polt, author of <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=4294988995\">The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist’s Companion for the 21st Century</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2011/may/11/authors-typewriters-in-pictures\">Key workers: writers at their typewriters - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You’d never guess that the mild-mannered professor of philosophy at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, is a radical. Yet, his book opens with a manifesto that asserts the right to “resist the paradigm” and “escape the data stream”.</p> <p>Polt typed that original declaration in 2012, motivated by an irritation with digital life and the knowledge that lots of young people were doing interesting things with typewriters. “The fact is that they’re turning to something non-digital for something that’s usually done digitally,” he pointed out during an interview prior to the book fair. </p> <p>Having collected typewriters for more than 20 years, Polt decided to join the “typosphere” and start “typecasting”. Simply put, he uses a typewriter to capture his thoughts, then scans the page and uploads it to his blog. (He maintains two websites: <a href=\"http://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/\">The Classic Typewriter</a> and <a href=\"http://writingball.blogspot.com/\">The Typewriter Revolution</a>.) </p> <p>He also began attending and hosting type-ins, which he describes in his book as “public acts of typewriting”. These informal events unite like-minded typists for swapping, letter writing, speed contests and, sometimes, political activism. The first type-in was held in Philadelphia in 2010 by a “band of renegades assembled at Bridgewater’s Pub in Philadelphia”. Other, more practical acts of typing nonconformity followed: Occupy Wall Street protestors in Portland, Oregon, conducted type-ins once their power had been cut off by the local authorities.</p> <p>The mania for old-fashioned typewriters has only intensified in recent years. There is now a service called <a href=\"http://typewriterrodeo.com/\">Typewriter Rodeo</a> that provides custom, on-demand, typewritten poetry at social events. Tom Hanks – yes, that one – created a top-selling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/19/tom-hanks-hanx-writer-typewriter-app-itunes-chart\">typewriter app</a>. At this year’s Burning Man, there was the installation of an enormous, climbable typewriter called the <a href=\"http://burningman.org/event/brc/2015-art-installations/#BlunderwoodPortable\">Blunderwood Portable</a>. And, in addition to Polt’s guide, two other books devoted to typewriters and typewriter art were published this fall: Tony Allan’s illustrated gift book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Typewriter-The-History-Machines-Writers/dp/1627950346\">The Typewriter: the History, the Machines, the Writers</a>, for which Polt served as consultant, and Ruth and Marvin Sackner’s <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/the-art-of-typewriting-hardcover\">The Art of Typewriting</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/nov/05/tom-hanks-typewriter-stories-great-novels\">Tom Hanks beware: typewriters spawned rubbish as well as great novels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But those who might hurl terms like “nostalgic” or “hipster” at the 50-year-old Polt and his comrades would be missing the mark. Polt locates the typewriter trend in the “slow movement” and the “maker movement” – both of which play into the idea that denizens of the 21st century need digital detox – but he connects his analog passion to contemporary issues of sustainability. Modern technology requires constant updating and replacement, but the decades-old machines that Polt picks up in thrift shops and on eBay can often be refurbished with elbow grease and simple instructions (which he provides in his book, natch).</p> <p>These so-called defunct machines are also better at keeping secrets, which is why Polt also views the typewriter as an anti-surveillance tool. It was, he said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">revelations about the National Security Administration’s spying</a> that ultimately crystallised this project for him. After all, unlike email, typewritten correspondence cannot be hacked. (Government agencies, he reports, are the primary consumers of new typewriters.) </p> <p>The title of one of the chapters in Polt’s book is Choose Your Weapon. It may seem tongue-in-cheek, but the gun manufacturer Remington was actually one of the most popular 20th-century producers of standard and midsize typewriters alongside Royal, Olympia, Smith-Corona, Underwood, Olivetti and Hermes. Polt, whose personal collection of typewriters numbers around 300, was hard-pressed to name a favourite, but he is a fan of the 1937 Remington Noiseless Model Seven, his first typewriter, acquired in the late 1970s.</p> <p>As for his fulminating against digital life, he said: “It’s in the spirit of fun but it’s also sincere. I think these are real problems and we’re all aware of them now – that our digital activities erode our privacy, and they erode our ability to focus and concentrate, and they create a lot of superficial connections to other people but they’re not necessarily good for deep connections.”</p> <p>That said, Polt shuns neither computers nor social media, but he does believe that we need some distance from our devices. “At the most abstract level, that’s the message I’m trying to send with my book – that we need some perspective. We shouldn’t be wrapped up in the present day and present technology, so whether it’s through typewriters or some other device or just stepping away from your computer or role-playing or whatever it is, perspective is healthy.”<br /></p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Some might call typewriters a dead technology but a quiet revival is afoot, claims philosophy professor Richard Polt – spurred, in his case, by a fear of surveillance","headline":"Typists of the world, unite!

The new era brings a new name, with the retitling of the prize in honour of the investment firm that has stumped up the cash. The Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction has also announced a new ambition – to break America and become “the leading non-fiction book prize in the world”.</p> <p>It’s the first sign that literary prizes can still attract big money after a year of sponsorship drought, with both the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/19/folio-society-ends-sponsorship-of-folio-prize\">Folio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/new-sponsor-sought-for-100-000-impac-literary-award-1.2232674\">Impac</a> awards also announcing earlier this year that they were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/beyond-the-booker-in-defence-of-the-literary-prize\">searching for new backers</a>. </p> <p>Though some might jibe at the cheapening of a prize whose name – after the great 18th century writer and lexicographer – honoured the enlightened desire of its first sponsors to remain anonymous, it’s worth reflecting on the value of keeping it going at all. A major award can transform the life of a writer lucky enough to win one. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2015/nov/27/guardian-first-book-award-winner-andrew-mcmillan\">Just listen to the delight and surprise</a> in Andrew McMillan’s voice as he tries to come to terms with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/guardian-first-book-award-2015-andrew-mcmillan-poet\">winning the Guardian first book award</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/03/steve-silberman-neurotribes-autism-samuel-johnson-prize-2015-interview\">Steve Silberman on winning the Samuel Johnson prize: 'I was broke, broke, broke'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of the value of a book award lays in the creative freedom the money buys for writers. When the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/07/kevin-barry-impac-award\">Irish novelist Kevin Barry bagged the Impac in 2013</a>, he summed up what a prize means by explaining that it “buys you a lot of time to be sitting at your desk, inventing deranged little worlds”. “It allows you to keep going,” Barry went on. “That’s the definition of success for a writer.” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/07/windham-campbell-books-prizes-150000\">Aminatta Forna welcomed her unexpected Windham-Campbell award</a> by saying the £90,000 award offered “what we most crave … time to write, free from deadlines, financial pressures, the expectations of others”.</p> <p>But in a literary world increasingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/20/earnings-authors-below-minimum-wage\">divided between the haves and the have-nots</a>, literary awards could be seen as part of the problem, sucking the life out of the midlist by focusing attention on a tiny fraction of the new titles published each year. Prizes may generate column inches for beleaguered publishers, but do they generate the sales that writers depend on to keep sitting at that desk?</p> <p>“The short answer is yes,” says Nielsen Bookscan’s Andre Breedt. “They definitely boost sales for the books that are nominated and the books that win. And these are often books that most people won’t have heard of.” But whether the increase in profile that a prize can offer brings people into bookshops and creates new sales, or simply directs the attention of habitual book buyers towards a lucky few, is difficult to discern. “It depends what you mean by ‘new’ sales,” Breedt says. “Obviously there are book buyers who hear about books they otherwise wouldn’t, but the data can’t show whether they would have bought another book instead.”</p> <p>It’s difficult to imagine what literary culture would look like without the constant merry-go-round of laureates and losers, but as the newly minted Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction attests, there’s no sign the carousel will be stopping any time soon.</p> <ul> <li><em>As a reader, what do literary prizes mean to you?

writer and television producer who in 1977 chose to be, in effect, demoted, in order to spend a year working as script editor during Tom Baker’s years in Doctor Who. When he joined the BBC in November 1963 Read had noticed the show’s very first instalments being recorded in one of the studios. By the 1970s, he was a seasoned writer and producer of drama, and was reluctant to accept a post offered to him as script editor – until told which series he was being asked to join. Read’s vast experience, calm demeanour and forensic aptitude for structuring scripts provided essential ballast for the Doctor Who producer Graham Williams. When one script fell through at the last minute, together they hurriedly wrote the season climax, conceiving <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/invasiontime/\">The Invasion of Time</a> (1978) set on the Doctor’s home planet, Gallifrey.</p> <p>Read also helped to develop the first television script from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/15/guardianobituaries.books\">Douglas Adams</a>, whose four-episode Doctor Who story Pirate Planet (1978) was at first deemed too complex by the BBC’s head of serials <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-graeme-mcdonald-1234646.html\">Graeme MacDonald</a>. Read and the director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/06/pennant-roberts-obituary\">Pennant Roberts</a> felt that Adams was a talent worth backing and so fought for it to remain in production. They won, and helped to structure Adams’s wild ideas into a coherent narrative.</p> <p>The adventure became part of the first season of the show to utilise an umbrella theme: in an unusual move, Read and Williams decided to link the individual stories with a framing narrative concerning the Doctor’s search for the Key to Time, a futuristic plot device aimed at restoring balance to the universe. After Read left the show (having installed Adams as his successor as script editor), he contributed an adventure entitled The Horns of Nimon (1979), which was based on the Minotaur myth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a812ae5b4b1e5497c47bb0fcd63c34e66597a3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6a812ae5b4b1e5497c47bb0fcd63c34e66597a3/40_95_3270_1962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of The Baker Street Boys, 1983, the drama series about a group of urchins who assist Sherlock Holmes, which was co-written by Anthony Read.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of The Baker Street Boys, 1983, the drama series about a group of urchins who assist Sherlock Holmes, which was co-written by Anthony Read.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex  Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Read was born in Cheslyn Hay, a small mining village in Staffordshire. His father, Frederick, a miner, died in the pit when Anthony was seven, leaving his mother, Lottie, to bring him up alone. He was educated at Queen Mary’s grammar school in Walsall, which had a strong theatrical tradition, and then enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. National service interrupted his studies and after demobilisation he set up a theatre company with the actor <a href=\"http://ianhendry.com/\">Ian Hendry</a> and toured eastern Europe as a fledgling actor-manager, taking lead roles or manning the tills, as necessary, often both on the same night.</p> <p>Realising that he was not cut out for acting, he headed to Fleet Street, aiming for work in advertising copywriting while submitting scripts to television companies. He was eventually asked to join the BBC, where he became a protege of the innovative head of drama <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-sydney-newman-1292055.html\">Sydney Newman</a>, adapting stories, writing original scripts and serving as story editor for series such as Detective (1964, starring Rupert Davies), The Indian Tales of Rudyard Kipling (1964) and Sherlock Holmes (1965, starring Douglas Wilmer).</p> <p>From 1965 he script-edited Mogul (later entitled The Troubleshooters), a drama about the oil industry starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">Geoffrey Keen</a>, also producing it from 1966, and in 1972 The Lotus Eaters (featuring his friend Hendry). In 1980 he script-edited the 13 one-off thrillers in the Hammer House of Horror series.</p> <p>Among more than 200 television writing credits were Z Cars (1976-77), The Professionals (1977-80), The Omega Factor (1979), Sapphire and Steel (1981), the zoo vet series One By One (1984-85) and the New Zealand-based teen drama The Tribe (1999).</p> <p>His proudest small-screen achievements were Chocky (1984), a six-part adaptation of a John Wyndham novel about a boy befriending an extraterrestrial, for which he conceived two original sequels; and the award-winning The Baker Street Boys (1983), about a group of urchins who assist Sherlock Holmes. Between 2005 and 2009 Read wrote six well received and widely translated novels based around the Baker Street characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9963630f0e66ee9c62ba2199cefd4b7705ea09ce\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9963630f0e66ee9c62ba2199cefd4b7705ea09ce/37_97_2690_1615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of Anthony Read’s proudest small-screen achievements was Chocky, 1984, a six-part adaptation of a John Wyndham novel about a boy befriending an extraterrestrial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Anthony Read’s proudest small-screen achievements was Chocky, 1984, a six-part adaptation of a John Wyndham novel about a boy befriending an extraterrestrial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had other major successes in print, largely as a writer of historical non-fiction. Kristallnacht: Unleashing the Holocaust won the Wingate literary prize in 1989. Other works (some co-written with a former Doctor Who colleague, David Fisher) included Operation Lucy: The Most Secret Spy Ring of the Second World War (1980), Colonel Z: the Secret Lives of a Master of Spies (1984), The Deadly Embrace: Hitler, Stalin and the Nazi-Soviet Pact 1939-1941 (1988) and The Proudest Day: India’s Long Road to Independence (1997).</p> <p>Read was an active member of the Writers’ Guild, serving as chair between 1981 and 1982, and drawing up an industry-wide code of practice on behalf of the young writers he was committed to nurturing, never taking pay or expenses for his work on the guild’s behalf. He was also a director of the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society. He co-wrote a proposal from the Writers’ Guild and the Directors and Producers Association that was submitted to the Annan committee on the future of broadcasting and was subsequently used as part of the charter agreement for establishing Channel 4.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Rosemary (nee Kirby), whom he married in 1958, and their two daughters.</p> <p>• Anthony Read, writer, editor and

week?","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-30T15:00:17Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1085","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ejta","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s a roundup of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/nov/23/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos from last week</a> – it’s all about short books and short stories this week, perfect to squeeze in before longer holiday reads.</p> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10628952\">TimHannigan</a> is in the middle of a run of Very Short Books as recommended by fellow TLSers: <br /></p> <blockquote> <p>The latest was <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Singing_Bowl.html?id=B0AWAAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">The Singing Bowl</a> by Alistair Carr, as recommended by @laidbackviews. It’s a short travel book about time spent (mostly) in Mongolia. It’s very cleanly written, with a strong sense of the grubbiness and thin thread of drunken violence that runs through Ulan Bator (never been myself, but I have two close family members who live and work there). I also think there’s a lot to be said for the travelogue condensed into novella length. There was, however, something oddly amateurish about the book as a piece of travel literature. I couldn’t quite put my finger on what it was, though being written in the present tense was part of the problem. Travelogues written in the present tense always sound like either magazine articles, or the naïve and solipsistic “what I did on my holidays” pieces that people sometimes read at open mic “writers’ events”. </p> </blockquote> <p>RedBirdFlies <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5641e974e4b01f2de9df966f/1812574\">is reading</a> Toni Morrison’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/29/god-help-the-child-toni-morrison-review-novel\">God Help the Child</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>A thought-provoking, evocative novel that deserves more than one reading, demonstrating the ease with which Toni Morrison and her narrative skill are able to skate into the 21st century, to pick up and explore the nuances of another of society’s dysfunctional aspects, that the things you do and say to children in their early years really matter and will impact their adult perceptions, actions and relationships. However, there are moments, that if grasped, can and do lead one out of that.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"575431d0c9ac3388abfc800f4873ece8853cf6b1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448880351697/dadefd09-4c5c-4d6a-9c4d-6d0946b97a6b-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"morrison\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnson is one of the rare writers who fully inhabits a character of the opposite sex. His characters are heart-breaking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3690773\">fingerlakeswanderer</a> shared her most moving reading experience this week, which was not of a book but a short story in last month’s <em>Harper’s</em> magazine. </p> <blockquote> <p>I’ve mentioned before that I rarely read short stories, mostly because I don’t have time to form attachments to characters in a short space. Well, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/20/national-book-award-adam-johnson-storytelling-isnt-a-game-to-me\">Adam Johnson</a> got to me in his short story.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2015/06/interesting-facts/\">Interesting Facts</a>, which is also contained in his recent National Book Award-winning collection <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/361283/\">Fortune Smiles</a><em>, </em>is a remarkable “meta” story. It is narrated by a character who is the wife of a recent Pulitzer-prize winning author who has written a book about North Korea. Which would seem to be Johnson himself, having won the Pulitzer for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/orphan-masters-son-adam-johnson-review\">The Orphanmaster’s Son</a><em>, </em>a phenomenal piece of work that I recommend. The narrator has breast cancer, and she narrates the story through the scrim of chemotherapy, which I have heard from friends who have undergone it, gets into your brain in ways that are difficult to describe if you haven’t experienced it. I guess it’s sort of the way your brain can feel sometimes during pregnancy, when you are flooded with hormones that feel as if they are blocking you from reaching parts of your brain that you know are there. This is what it’s like for the wife, who knows she’s dying, and is failing to make herself understood.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"143ec04cdc69ea7f13b4ccda7e7482642525959f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448881128477/a731767e-b6a2-43a8-9e02-84fb4f3cabf8-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"graham greene\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>I don’t want to give too much away, but Johnson is one of the rare writers who fully inhabits a character of the opposite sex. His characters are heart-breaking, and while mentioning that the wife is dying might explain the fact that the story made me weep, it’s not that actually. That would be too facile. What made me weep were small moments that Johnson’s language conveyed in ways that went right for the gut. Makes me tempted to pony up and buy the collected stories in hardback.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5641e974e4b01f2de9df966f/1807628\">JohnWreford</a> found <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/third-man-and-the-fallen-idol.html\">The Fallen Idol and Third Man</a> by Graham Greene while having a rummage in an Istanbul bookshop:</p> <blockquote> <p>I have been a fan of Greene for as long as I can remember and relish the chance to re-read anything I can find. I am always leaving them on train seats or in boxes as I leave one country to live in another. I didn’t actually intend my life to live out like a Graham Greene novel but it often seems than way.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Interesting links about books and reading</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/41314/on-pandering.html\">On Pandering</a>: “Myself, I have been writing to impress old white men.

While the drab working class in the districts toil in poverty and filth and boring clothes, Capitol citizens stroll about in pampered splendour. President Snow raises white perfumed roses. His populace is decked out in gaudily colored costumes, preposterous coiffures and elaborately styled facial hair. The upper-class, in short, is decadent – and decadence, in both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hunger-games\">Suzanne Collins’ books</a> and the films, means flamboyant femininity.</p> <p>Disgust with, and hatred of femininity is often linked to hatred of women – as in the uber-masculine James Bond novels, with their casual disdain for the disposable sex objects who cross the hero’s path. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/18/how-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-staged-a-revolution\">How The Hunger Games staged a revolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hunger Games doesn’t hate women, though. Its hero is a woman. But, as a woman, she is a hero precisely because she rejects the traditional roles of femininity. At home in District 12, Katniss wears utilitarian, drab clothing. After her father dies, she steps into his role as provider and hunter, leaving the confines of the domestic village for adventures in the woods. When her sister is threatened, Katniss does the stereotypical manly, heroic thing. You could certainly say her feelings for her sister are maternal, but she expresses them most dramatically through being iconically paternal – by going into battle to protect her family.</p> <p>The Hunger Games does put Katniss in female roles with some regularity – but it invariably does so to emphasize those roles’ artificiality, and her distance and discomfort with them. She wears a series of striking, literally incendiary dresses, which in the films emphasise Jennifer Lawrence’s considerable glamour. But, while Katniss admires these dresses (and shares a bond of deep affection with designer Cinna), she’s wearing them because she has to, not because she wants to. She has to dress up first in order to win sponsors to help her during the Hunger Games battle, and then to inspire the resistance against the capital. The dresses are a performance. They function as a kind of drag, not an expression of her own gender identity or choices. </p> <p>Similarly, Katniss’s romance plot is presented as a front. She and Peeta pretend to be in love for the cameras to, again, woo sponsors and to assure President Snow that their main interest is true love, not rebellion. The wedding preparations are an elaborate ruse, which underlines Katniss’s distance from the traditional feminine romance narrative. She doesn’t want marriage and happily ever after; she is not that feminine archetype. If she could, she would head for the woods.</p> <p>Peeta, on the other hand, is committed to the romance story. He loves Katniss and expresses that directly. He also fills the role, usually reserved for women, of damsel in distress. Katniss (and others) save him repeatedly from danger and death. Just as writers like Dickens present their pure female characters as paragons, so Peeta, filling the feminine role, becomes a kind of touchstone of purity and self-sacrifice. But since he is associated with love and femininity, he is also, in the logic of the film, a terrifying threat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/04/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-review-jennifer-lawrence\">The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 review: Jennifer Lawrence drags franchise through final round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1\">the first part of Mockingjay</a>, a team frees Peeta from where he has been tortured in the Capitol. It’s significant that this sequence is juxtaposed with Finnick, a Hunger Games survivor, describing his sexual abuse at the hands of the upper-class elites; love and sex in the corrupt, feminised Capitol, are synonymous with perversion and violence. And sure enough, when Peeta is returned to Katniss, he tries to kill her. The film explains this by saying that he has been tortured and conditioned. But you could also read it as an expression of the Hunger Games’s deep ambivalence around, and distrust of, the feminine. Peeta believes in the romance plot; Peeta is a damsel in distress. That means Peeta is dangerous. Femininity: be careful, or it will grab you by the neck and choke you to death.</p> <p>Masculinity has its downsides too, obviously. The Hunger Games series is built around the kill-or-be-killed excitement of the tournament to the death, and it celebrates Katniss for her superheroic, stereotypically masculine competence in battle. Filmgoers watch Katniss fight with the same excitement as do the inhabitants of the decadent Capitol. But the narrative also shows the traumatic consequences of battle, war, and iconically masculine violence. Katniss’s romance plot doesn’t make her happy, but her heroism plot certainly doesn’t either. </p> <p>The Hunger Games is a bleak series because of its political pessimism – both the status quo and the revolutionary response to the status quo are presented as cruel, bloody and tragic. That political despair seems built, in no small part, on the way the series can see no comfortable gender role for its central hero. Katniss doesn’t get to even provisionally enjoy the work of death and action-heroing the way James Bond does. But possible alternatives – love, children, even just wearing pretty clothes – are all also viewed with suspicion. To be a hero in the Hunger Games, you need to pick up those masculine weapons and wage war to stomp out the frills and frippery. What’s left is a drab and violent world.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Despite its female hero, The Hunger Games constantly depicts the conventional trappings of femininity as decadent, weak and dangerous. <strong>Warning: spoilers</strong>","headline":"The Hunger Games world is no country for glamorous women","byline":"Noah Berlatsky","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/fd3157eaffe6e87ba6c0430d879227399ad4be0a/0_132_3000_1802/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-12-03T15:00:17Z","standfirst":"<p>Despite its female hero, The Hunger Games constantly depicts the conventional trappings of femininity as decadent, weak and dangerous. <strong>Warning: spoilers</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/30/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-two-women-femininity","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/nov/30/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-two-women-femininity","sectionName":"Film","elements":[{"id":"fd3157eaffe6e87ba6c0430d879227399ad4be0a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/fd3157eaffe6e87ba6c0430d879227399ad4be0a/0_132_3000_1802/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/fd3157eaffe6e87ba6c0430d879227399ad4be0a","suppliersReference":"CAET206","altText":"The Hunger Games Mockingjay -

His neighbour and best friend Rachel Watts just wishes she could go back to the countryside but she finds herself being dragged into Mycroft’s dark and exciting world when he asks her for help in solving a murder. What starts out as an innocent investigation into the death of a friend begins to turn into something much more dangerous.</p> <p>The concept of this book is rather compelling. The Sherlock Holmes links were really fun and it was interesting to see the Holmes and Watson relationship taking a new form and direction. </p> <p>Rachel, the narrator, was quite a bland character; her family and her longing to leave the city didn’t resonate like Mycroft’s backstory and personality did. As a result, the scenes with Mycroft were much more engaging and the scenes without him seemed flat and boring in comparison. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d6f742f453e4153e6186b4eba7ba5e1fbe7086d6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/11/1447262793638/142af9c4-cc5e-44a1-8383-8c9575038d8e-284x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ellie Marney\" width=\"284\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That being said, the majority of the novel was built around the investigation that they embark on. This was actually really fascinating especially when they were discussing the forensics of the murder and the inferences they could make from it. This was where the novel was at its strongest, as it was generally fast paced and explored Mycroft and Watts’ relationship both in solving cases and as friends. </p> <p>The twists in the story were well executed and unexpected, reminiscent of Arthur Conan Doyle himself. Overall this novel was enjoyable to read but its narrator weighed the story down and prevented it from having more of an effect on the reader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

media coverage of whether to drop bombs on Syria, I wondered what it feels like to be a child living in a place that is being bombed. Are there any books that describe it well? </p> </blockquote> <p>Bombing of the kind that is being discussed at the moment is designed to harm ordinary citizens. As you suggest, that includes children who will be scared for themselves and their families and friends. </p> <p>Even as far back as during the bombing of Britain during the second world war, children’s lives were shattered – by the London Blitz in particular, but also by the bombing of other strategic cities and areas of the UK. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e6c72c24194e9ed114134bca78c0f8a6eee647b6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448891074821/5b6ba4dd-ddfc-4457-a113-4da7b378df24-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Machine gunners\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Robert Westall spent his childhood on Tyneside during the second world war. He told stories from that time to his son Christopher and later came to draw on them for his first book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/280970/\">The Machine Gunners</a>, which won the Carnegie medal in 1975. </p> <p>In it, Westall vividly describes Tyneside, or Garmouth as it is called in the story, which was heavily bombed. The impact of the nightly bombing on the children’s daily life was considerable and Westall captures well the background fear which pervaded their outwardly normal home and school life. But there was adventure too. When Chas McGill finds a crashed German bomber, he takes out one of the guns and sets it up so that he can see off the enemy himself! Writing with hindsight and at a time when less was thought about the psychological damage of war, Westall employs the technique of empowering Chas McGill as a way of helping him to take control and to overcome his fear. He also uses it as a way of making Chas and his friends think about what the war is really all about and whether it should be happening. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71bb6afece74374de04fbbfa4e3b5cba65dde4b4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448891823332/59459826-628f-4117-89ca-d4cbd567aaea-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Goodnight mr Tom\" width=\"267\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Two other great UK novels about the second world war, Michelle Magorian’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/goodnight-mister-tom-6.html\">Goodnight Mister Tom</a> and Nina Bawden’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/carrie-s-war.html\">Carrie’s War</a>, explore the experiences of children’s whose lives have been altered forever by bombing and the threat of it. </p> <p>William Beech in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/goodnight-mister-tom-6.html\">Goodnight Mister Tom</a> as well as Carrie and her younger brother Nick in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/carrie-s-war.html\">Carrie’s War</a> are sent to live in the country to escape the devastation of the Blitz. All three children are taken from their parents and face total displacement from everything they have known. For William especially, but even for Carrie and Nick, the new experiences are not all bad but in both books the life-changing nature of bombing civilians lies at the heart of the story and the anxiety of having lived through it is never far away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"666b7ff502e60f06c13496debffe6392e5544a93\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448891971158/12c819ab-1fa5-4c74-874f-cdaa717b5aab-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Oranges in no man's land\" width=\"232\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For Anna in Judith Kerr’s Bombs <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/bombs-on-aunt-dainty.html\">Bombs on Aunt Dainty</a>, the second title in her <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/when-hitler-stole-pink-rabbit-bombs-on-aunt-dainty.html\">When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit</a> sequence, living through the London Blitz as a teenager is full of terror. Kerr vividly describes the upheaval of the nights of the bombing and the fear that goes with it. For Anna there is the additional anxiety as her status as an “enemy alien” which would put her and her family at risk if the Germans managed to invade. </p> <p>The impact of modern conflicts on children is brilliantly captured by Elizabeth Laird in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/oranges-in-no-man-s-land.html\">Oranges in No Man’s Land</a>. In a moving story of bravery and courage, ten year old Ayesha lives with her granny in Beirut, a bombed out city divided by civil war, following the death of her mother in a shell attack. The two sides of the war are kept strictly apart by the strip of No Man’s Land that runs between them. When her granny falls ill, Ayesha must bravely cross the strip that is home only to tanks and soldiers. Here, and in everything else she does, Ayesha’s whole life is shaped by growing up in a country dominated by war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2ac95ab908ac9cfd0a813f2ea4275cca860d324f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/30/1448892744916/1a07e66e-5a12-4276-aadd-ff8d4d05dcbb-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Palestine\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For older readers Joe Sacco’s graphic novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/palestine-3.html\">Palestine</a> is the most powerful of all stories about living in a war zone.

Sceptics sneer at its mention, assuming it’s as discreditable as penis envy. Others, who sense the father of psychoanalysis was on to something, prefer to hedge their bets and not be tarnished by Freud’s mixed reputation: they refer limply to the subliminal or subconscious. Yet it could be the case that far from being past its sell-by date, the time of the unconscious is yet to come.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/06/comment.mainsection1\">Paul Broks on 150 years of Sigmund Freud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reasons are twofold: science and necessity. First, neuroscience has demonstrated conclusively that there’s far more going on in the mind than the owners of those minds are generally aware. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Solms\" title=\"\">Mark Solms</a>, a professor of neuropsychology and psychoanalyst who has pioneered much of the effort to test Freud’s findings against the neuroscientific, often points out that the conscious mind is capable of attending to six or seven things at once, while the rest of the nervous system is performing thousands. In that light, it seems perverse to deny that much of psychic life lies over the horizon of our awareness, doubly so when you consider experiences such as dreaming and slips of the tongue, or ordeals from infancy that can’t be remembered and yet demonstrably shape adult life.</p> <p>So the real debate, today, is whether the mechanisms that Freud ascribed to the unconscious – the so-called dynamic unconscious – were right. Take repression, the purposeful forgetting of memories that subsequently return as neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Freud argued this happens because an experience or thought is unpalatable or overwhelming, whereas cognitive psychology tends to resist such a notion. It prefers a static conception of unconscious contents. Memories can be lost, for sure, and linked to unexplained symptoms. But those symptoms cannot be read in meaningful or symbolic ways as Freud and his followers have contrived in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_cure\" title=\"\">“talking cure”</a>.</p> <p>The science, though, is building to challenge this view. One line of research examines certain amnesic conditions in which patients fabricate memories and deny they can’t recall what actually happened. Such confabulations have been shown to follow the rules that Freud identified in a dynamic unconscious. They carry meaning. Alternatively, there are those who suffer from paraphasia, a syndrome in which forgotten words are substituted by others. The substitutions similarly show patterns that mirror those Freud detected in dreams and slips. The evidence is that repression is a key characteristic of the unconscious.</p> <p>The second reason that the unconscious is worth exploring has to do with medical necessity. Take the phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms. These are widespread and everyday. In her recent book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/07/all-in-your-head-review-o-sullivan-suzanne-osullivan\" title=\"\">It’s All in Your Head</a>, neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan reports that up to a third of people who go to the doctor have them. Their distress is real; the patient is not making it up. And yet no biological cause can be found. When you consider how much this costs – one 2005 study for such psychosomatic disorders estimates an annual cost of over $250bn in the US alone – it’s clear that any reasonable candidate for explanation should be investigated with urgency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/07/comment.willhutton\">Will Hutton: A time to celebrate, not denigrate, Freud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The unconscious is one candidate, and conversion disorders provide a case in point. Also known as hysteria, these too are remarkably prevalent. All neurology clinics, for example, will have on their books many individuals with lives severely limited by seizures, but for whom an EEG reveals no epileptic activity in the brain. Other patients will be impaired by breathlessness, blindness, pain, paralysis. As O’Sullivan admits, even though there’s now technology to see inside the brain, the science is barely providing leads, let alone explanations.</p> <p>But Freud’s central idea on conversion disorders – namely that a trauma, or perceived trauma, lies at the origin – is now routinely shown to have clinical efficacy. At a <a href=\"http://www.freud.org.uk/events/76091/-studies-on-hysteria-anniversary-debate/\" title=\"\">recent debate</a> on this subject at the Freud Museum in London, Richard Kanaan, a neuropsychiatrist, and Stephanie Howlett, a psychotherapist, made the case. When you examine patient histories carefully – which of course takes time, training and money – the dissociations and meaning of the symptoms often emerge. They advise treating patients across disciplines: Howlett works in conjunction with psychologists, physiotherapists and neurologists. As Kanaan put it, if Freud had referred to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) rather than hysteria, he would now be remembered as a pioneering hero.</p> <p>No one is saying that the unconscious is a magic bullet. These are often complex conditions. Freud himself stressed that working with the unconscious is painstaking precisely because it is unconscious. Further, psychoanalysis has itself radically revised Freud’s original conclusions. But it now holds a century of wisdom on engaging this hidden and sometimes devastatingly powerful part of ourselves. Freud believed his work was only a beginning. Scientific research and sheer human need suggest we should energetically continue what he started.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"After a century of being derided, Freud’s ideas are quite rightly being re-evaluated – as they could shed light on some of medicine’s great unknowns","headline":"100 years old and making a comeback – Freud’s theories of the unconscious","byline":"Mark Vernon","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/cdb847784c79baa474551efa7432612308e5c211/0_376_4056_2435/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-12-03T13:48:52Z","standfirst":"After a century of being derided, Freud’s ideas are quite rightly being re-evaluated – as they could shed light on some of medicine’s great unknowns"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/30/sigmund-freud-unconscious-theories","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/30/sigmund-freud-unconscious-theories","sectionName":"Comment is free","elements":[{"id":"cdb847784c79baa474551efa7432612308e5c211","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/cdb847784c79baa474551efa7432612308e5c211/0_376_4056_2435/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

But Shukla, who has led a groundswell of anger about the issue on social media after he highlighted the fact that the list of titles announced for 2016 World Book Night failed to include a single BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) writer, said that publishing as a whole was keen to shift the blame elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/25/world-book-night-criticised-all-white-2016-giveaway-list\">World Book Night criticised for all-white 2016 giveaway list</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s a perfect loop-de-loop of blame and it gets very wearing – nobody wants to take responsibility,” Shukla, author of novels <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/meatspace.html\">Meatspace</a> and Coconut Unlimited, said. “When you criticise prizes and review coverage and lists for not being diverse enough, you’re told it’s because of what publishers are submitting, that it just reflects what publishers are putting out. So you say OK, publishers, and they say what they publish reflects what they’re sent by agents, so you say to agents, ‘where are the brown people?’ and they say they don’t discriminate, they just aren’t getting submissions through.”</p> <p>“So you say it’s the writers’ fault. So you speak to writers, and they say they look at the prizes, the lists, the reviews, the bookshops, and they don’t see themselves reflected. So whose responsibility is it? I’ve taken it on myself to be my responsibility. I’m still not particularly well-known, but I have people’s attention, so I can shout for the people who feel disenfranchised … And I wouldn’t be wasting my time if I didn’t feel there was a potential financial reward for investing in BAME writers.”</p> <p>Shukla said has been contacted by more than 40 BAME writers since he offered on Twitter to pass on contacts to those looking for representation. He has also joined the bloggers Naomi Frisby (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frizbot\">@frizbot</a>) and Dan L (@utterbiblio) in their launch of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DiverseDecember\">#diversedecember</a> campaign, which will celebrate BAME writers throughout next month. Shukla is also editing <a href=\"https://unbound.co.uk/books/the-good-immigrant\">The Good Immigrant</a>, a book of essays from British BAME writers on race and immigration for <a href=\"https://unbound.co.uk/\">Unbound</a>, with contributors including Buzzfeed’s Bim Adewunmi and playwright <a href=\"http://www.sabrinamahfouz.com/\">Sabrina Mahfouz</a>.</p> <p>“In publishing circles, I’m often the only person of colour in a room and I’m made to feel very aware of that. If we are to tackle this problem, people like me need to feel welcome,” Shukla said. “Everyone keeps saying ‘I am not prejudiced, or racist’, but they won’t say it is my responsibility as well to try and do better.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/15/how-bookshops-can-support-diversity-female-writers\">Battling bias on the shop floor: how bookstores can support diversity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novelist said that “every time I’ve talked about this, I’ve got small presses and authors and bloggers backing me. I have hardly had any major publisher go ‘yeah, you’re right, we need to change this’. I’ve had a couple of agents come forward, but where are the major publishers? They’re looking at their feet until the show’s over.”</p> <p>Shukla’s voice was joined yesterday by that of Jon McGregor, winner of the 2012 Impac prize for his novel <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/even-the-dogs.html\">Even the Dogs</a>. Speaking at the Cambridge literature festival, McGregor was blistering in his condemnation of the current status quo.</p> <p>“The problem is one of structure. The problem is one of form. The entire culture and apparatus of the published novel was developed by an economic elite with leisure time on its hands, and the descendants of that class work to perpetuate an environment in which their own sort feel at home, while others are accepted only as hyphenated anomalies: the working-class-writer, the black-writer, the gay-writer, the disabled-writer, the woman-writer,” said McGregor, in the final event in <a href=\"http://www.writerscentrenorwich.org.uk/thenationalconversation.aspx\">Writers’ Centre Norwich’s National Conversation</a> series, which had also seen authors Kerry Hudson and Kamila Shamsie underline the need for diversity.</p> <p>“This lack of diversity is more pervasive than even these previous contributions to the National Conversation have suggested,” said McGregor, adding that it was “time to open the doors to these many different writers”.</p> <p>“If we’re serious about diversity, and about wanting to hear the great stories that we’re currently missing out on, then it’s time to do things differently,” the novelist said.</p> <p>“It’s time to stop asking our writers to conform to a Victorian ideal of the public intellectual. Time to get rid of the lectern, to move the chairs around, to celebrate the art of the storyteller. Let’s take literature out of the lecture theatre, out of the drawing room, and away from the pulpit; let’s set it loose from the soiree and the salon. Let’s start with a blank page, and open the door to new audiences; and to the new writers who will come from those new audiences.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Nikesh Shukla calls industry’s backtracking ‘a perfect loop-de-loop of blame’ as he is joined by Jon McGregor in a

a girl called Jade, who woke up one day thinking she was somebody completely different, called Janet. I very much enjoyed this book because not everything makes sense at the start, but it makes you want to read on until the very end, where you have to fit everything together, like a puzzle, like a mystery.</p> <p>My favourite character is Zan, (Jade’s brother) because even though he might not have the real Jade back, he is determined to find out what was causing all of these memories. If it wasn’t for him and everything he learns about Jade and Janet, they wouldn’t have found the cure to her misleading behaviour. I would definitely recommend this book for people who are fascinated by mystery, and making the puzzle piece by piece.

reads","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-23T16:08:47Z","fields":{"wordcount":"708","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","trailText":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle","headline":"UK freezes export of unique Erasmus manuscript by William Tyndale","byline":"Maev Kennedy","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"<strong>Richard Coles:</strong> the crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert to the gap between what was said and what was done","headline":"PD James remembered by Richard Coles","byline":"Richard Coles","commentable":"true","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

to read over Thanksgiving","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-26T13:00:05Z","fields":{"wordcount":"830","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more

for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

by Lindsay Hunter review: teenagers on the road to nowhere","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-13T19:48:59Z","fields":{"wordcount":"710","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"This debut novel exposes truths about class,

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"This west African thriller
