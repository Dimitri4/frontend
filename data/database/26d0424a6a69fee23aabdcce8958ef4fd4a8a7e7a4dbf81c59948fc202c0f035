The worst thing about this terrifying insurgency? My mum is part of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/06/were-not-cult-members-labour-supporters-at-corbyn-rallies\">'We're not cult members': Labour supporters at Corbyn rallies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am, of course, talking about the people who support Jeremy Corbyn – 12,000 of whom have joined <a href=\"http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/\">Momentum</a>, the activist movement that propelled Corbyn to power. And after Monday’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court win and a clean sweep in the elections</a> to Labour’s national executive committee, support for Corbyn shows no signs of abating – despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/762699781546381312?s=09\">continued suggestions</a> that those supporters are nothing more than an abusive rabble. How many of the journalists writing panicked screeds about these awful people have actually met any of them, do you think? I ask because writing about the Corbyn phenomenon over the last year means I’ve met probably hundreds of his supporters and to be honest, I find dealing with them the most pleasant element of writing about Corbyn.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I went to a political event that included a branch of Momentum. All young women; they were energetic, funny and very friendly. Two weeks ago, I had a debate with a Momentum member about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/14/does-jeremy-corbyn-have-a-media-strategy-apparently-not\">Corbyn’s media strategy</a>. Of the two of us, it was me who was the ruder, more impatient one. When Corbyn ran for leadership last year, I visited phone banks for him dozens of times, and spent hours in the company of the very people who went on to found Momentum. I told myself I was <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/11/britains-bernie-sanders-is-about-to-win-big-jeremy-corbyn-labour/\">researching a piece</a>; actually I think I just liked talking to them.</p> <p>Sure, my experiences of these Corbyn supporters might not be representative. But they do suggest that the depiction of them as a madcap bunch of deluded cultists is not representative either. Broadly speaking, the media has failed to understand the political moment in the Labour party; it has shown a damning lack of interest in the fact that people who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands – preferring instead to dismiss them as an angry mob.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One half of that description is accurate, however. Corbyn supporters may not be a mob, but they are angry. And to understand why, it is useful to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/jeremy-gilbert/is-momentum-mob-no-this-is-what-democracy-looks-like\">consider the words</a> of the academic Jeremy Gilbert, a longstanding Labour member and activist who has joined Momentum: “Momentum is simply trying to give a voice to a body of opinion which has been widespread throughout the country for many years, but has been denied any kind of place in our public life since the early days of New Labour. It is a body of opinion which believes, with good reason, that the embrace of neoliberal economics and neoconservative foreign policy under Blair was a disaster … Naturally some of those voices, suppressed for so long, sound raucous, aggressive and uncouth.”</p> <p>The anger that commentators detect in the Corbyn movement, in my experience, is not a symptom of the fact that it has been infiltrated by bullies – but that its members feel as though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/labour-coup-disastrous-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour coup</a> is as much an attack on their right to participate in public discourse as it is on Corbyn.</p> <p>Everything the left traditionally stands for – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\">human rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">socialism</a> to a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/02/the-iraq-wars- real-victims- laurie-penny- and-the- narcissistic-left/\">foreign policy driven by diplomacy</a> – has been, at best, marginalised and, at worst, actively mocked in mainstream political discourse since the 1970s. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of the trade unions, the last bastions of organised British socialism, as insidious barons intent on wrecking British life (a claim that sounds particularly ludicrous when made by newspapers who supported the Conservatives at the last election – a party consisting of members of the actual landed gentry).</p> <p>I am yet to meet a single Corbynite who is naive about Corbyn’s failings as a leader, the great challenges he faces, or who does not want to win a general election. But the reason so many have coalesced around him anyway is because they view his leadership as the only opportunity they have had in at least 30 years to see their views finally represented in public life. The Labour rebels’ attempt to unseat him is, in their minds, as much an attempt to excommunicate the wider left as it is to get rid of Corbyn himself. Perhaps the most salient evidence of this is the decision to charge affiliate members £25 to vote in the leadership election, and ban outright members who joined fewer than six months ago – a decision that has now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">overturned in court</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pd7c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2627517\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a06c0ae4b07e27cb7e00e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\">Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Worse still for Corbyn supporters, the policy positions they have taken over the last 30 years have often been proven right. Lack of social housing has led to a spiralling housing crisis; the deregulation of the financial industry would have caused economic collapse had it not been for state intervention; queasiness around public ownership has caused escalating transport costs and arguably the shambles that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Railway</a>; inequality is the UK’s most pressing social issue; a reluctance to rein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels\">fossil fuel companies</a> has led to a climate emergency; and even Tony Blair accepts that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-sorry-iraq-war-mistakes-admits-conflict-role-in-rise-of-isis\">Iraq war may have led to the rise of Isis</a>. This is why so many Corbyn supporters are upset by the coup, and why they have decided to back him unequivocally, in spite of the incompetence that has at times been part of his leadership.</p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/owen-smith-plan-low-paid-workers-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith</a> supporters who are horrified by Labour’s poll ratings. But I have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with Corbyn supporters, and who have not reflected on why they lost control of their party to someone they so clearly regard as useless. There are simply not enough delusional Leninists in Britain to make up the entirety of Corbyn’s support – these are ordinary British voters who want radical solutions to a growing number of crises. And until they are listened to and taken seriously, Corbyn and the movement keeping him in power is not going anywhere.</p>","wordcount":"1037","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T09:00:10Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T13:57:39Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T09:00:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57a88fd3e4b033cb0795e12e","internalOctopusCode":"11790594","internalPageCode":"2639723","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T10:04:27Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q3ve","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7246a34cbc130094b988fea5393cef35b5d22b1/0_352_5568_3342/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"113","internalShortId":"/p/4q3ve"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-voters-labour-leader-politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-voters-labour-leader-politics","webTitle":"Corbyn

</figure>","body":"<p>Former Labour leader Ed Miliband is emailing all party members, urging them to back Owen Smith against Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election.</p> <p>Miliband, the MP for Doncaster North, was among senior party figures calling for Corbyn to step down as leader after he lost the confidence of the majority of his MPs, and nominated Smith as leader.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjptaQC4pEM\">In a video</a>, he delivers a personal endorsement of Smith as the right person to lead Labour in the wake of June’s Brexit vote. He says the new prime minister, Theresa May, has adopted the “language of the left” but could take Britain to the right.</p> <p>Corbyn is widely thought to be ahead in the race, and his backers swept the board in elections to the party’s governing national executive committee, strengthening his control over Labour machinery.</p> <p>Ballot papers are due to be sent out in the coming days – though the timing of the contest has been thrown into doubt by Monday’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court ruling that 130,000 new members must be given a vote</a>, which the NEC now plans to appeal.</p> <p>Miliband stepped aside after he led Labour to defeat at last year’s general election. The changes he made to the system for electing Labour leaders – throwing the ballot open to party members and weakening the power of MPs and trades unions – helped Corbyn sweep to victory in last year’s leadership race.</p> <p>Miliband said Labour needed a leader who could “unite our party and make us a serious alternative government” and praised “the vision of a more equal society shining through” in Smith’s campaign.</p> <p>Corbyn and Smith will face each other in a second public hustings on Thursday night in Gateshead, against the background of an increasingly bitter battle for the future of Labour which saw Corbyn’s team hit back on Tuesday against claims by deputy leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Tom Watson that “Trotskyist entryists”</a> were seeking to gain control of the

rifts</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/tom-watson-interview-jeremy-corbyn-labour-rifts-hug-shout\">In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian</a>, in which he also called for the reintroduction of elections to the shadow cabinet and the return of the electoral college for selecting future Labour leaders, Watson said he was concerned that infiltration by Trotskyists would end up destroying the party.</p> <p>Corbyn’s campaign said the allegation was “a disappointing remark by Tom Watson, who seems to be sadly using the Owen Smith campaign’s ‘Project Fear’ approach to this election”.</p> <p>A spokesman said: “Rather than patronising members and peddling baseless conspiracy theories about ‘Trotsky entryists’, he should be working with Jeremy to unite our party so that we can get back to campaigning to dislodge this Tory government, and help elect a Labour government in its place.”</p> <p>Many members of the grassroots Momentum movement, set up to support Corbyn’s leadership, are “deeply interested in political change, in building a more equal society, and are just on a journey in politics that they’re new to”, Watson said. But he suggested some are being manipulated by seasoned hard-left operators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b02a54dd66b798ab2601f44df6010df83c6c1e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b02a54dd66b798ab2601f44df6010df83c6c1e9e/0_151_4318_2591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson asked Jeremy Corbyn to step down for the good of the party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There are some old hands twisting young arms in this process, and I’m under no illusions about what’s going on. They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that’s how Trotsky entryists operate. Sooner or later, that always ends up in disaster. It always ends up destroying the institutions that are vulnerable, unless you deal with it.”</p> <p>He added that some “Trots”, who have returned to Labour after being driven out decades ago, “certainly don’t have the best interests of the Labour party at heart. They see the Labour party as a vehicle for revolutionary socialism, and they’re not remotely interested in winning elections, and that’s a problem.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">Corbyn consolidates grip on Labour with high court and NEC successes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Watson says he does not blame Corbyn personally for the crisis in the party and instead feels “great sorrow” for him.</p> <p>The fractious nature of the leadership contest has been underlined by a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">legal challenges</a> to the party’s process in which Corbyn supporters have ended up on the opposite side to Labour’s governing national executive committee.</p> <p>But Watson sought to downplay fears that Labour could split if Corbyn retained the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/04/corbyn-and-smith-face-off-in-tense-labour-leadership-hustings\"> leadership after this summer’s election</a>.</p> <p>“Every single person I talk to on the left and right of the party thinks this is a bad idea. I’ve not had anyone muse with me about it. I’ve not had anyone gossip with me about it. I’ve not heard anyone raising it as an issue.”</p> <p>Watson, who was elected to his post by party members, urged Corbyn to step down in early July after he lost a vote of no confidence among Labour MPs by an overwhelming margin and suffered scores of resignations from his frontbench.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-voters-labour-leader-politics\">Corbyn supporters are not delusional Leninists but ordinary, fed-up voters | Ellie Mae O’Hagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He now says he barely speaks to his boss, communicating largely through occasional text messages – about the health of Watson’s father, for example. “We still send the odd text to each other. It’s usually about family stuff, you know.”</p> <p>As the battle for the future of Labour rages, Watson says allowing MPs a say over the composition of the shadow cabinet could help to “reshape and rebuild the parliamentary Labour party”.</p> <p>He also condemned Ed Miliband’s decision to ditch the electoral college for choosing Labour leaders, which allowed trade unions, MPs and party members to all have a say. Watson said this was a “terrible error of judgment” by Corbyn’s predecessor and that he would like to see it reinstated.</p> <p>Responding to Watson’s comments, the shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said he had “not seen the evidence that Tom has seen”, but added: “What I do observe is a worrying process of polarisation taking place [in the party], and it was what I was concerned about when I was arguing against a leadership election at this particular time.” </p> <p>“I am genuinely fearful about where this takes us,” said Burnham, speaking after he was named as Labour’s candidate for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-selected-labours-candidate-manchester-mayor\">Greater Manchester mayoral election</a> next year. </p> <p>“That’s why I came to the conclusion that the best way I can serve Labour is by doing what I’m doing now [and running for mayor] because I think we’ve got to always be mindful of the views of our party members but also get closer to the public.” <br

Practically overnight, Westminster’s most vivid characters – from the Notting Hill set to Nigel Farage – vanished. One of the few recognisable names still left on Labour’s front bench is Tom Watson, whose charismatic reputation and geeky glamour should therefore elevate him to celebrity status in this colourless new political landscape. But ever since the early hours of 24 June, Labour’s deputy leader has retreated behind a blank facial glaze so opaque as to render him completely inscrutable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Trotskyists 'twisting arms' of young Labour members to back Corbyn, Watson says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When appearing beside Jeremy Corbyn, he wears an expression normally reserved for funerals, which of course only makes me all the more curious to know what he is thinking. I ask about his thoughts while he watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-first-pmq-prime-minister-questions-panel\">Theresa May demolish Corbyn at her first prime minister’s questions</a>, and he starts to chuckle.</p> <p>“Well, at PMQs I always try to get myself into a Buddha-like state. I try not to have any facial expression at all. Because if I laugh at a Jeremy joke, two hours later on social media it’s either interpreted as me laughing at Jeremy, or laughing at an opposition joke. Or, if I scowl at something someone says, people are accusing me of scowling at Jeremy. So I try to keep a straight face, which everyone always interprets as me looking really sad and miserable. That’s actually not the case. I’m generally just trying to remain expressionless.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f/0_29_1746_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson does a good job at keeping it up for most of this interview, too. When we speak before the high court ruling on Labour’s leadership contest, the detached serenity he affects is disconcertingly implausible. But, as he points out several times, he will have to serve as deputy to whichever leader his party elects. “I’m 50 next year, so I’ve learned not to worry about the things you’ve got no control of. I’ve not really been in control of events in the last few weeks, and if I can’t control events, I can’t worry about them.”</p> <p>He certainly did not predict them. Watson had no idea that Labour’s leader would call for article 50 to be triggered at once, within hours of the referendum result. “But if I’m being honest, I’d not focused a lot on the plan B in the planning meetings that I’d had with him.”</p> <p>Failing to anticipate the impact Corbyn’s words would have on Labour MPs – “At that point I was so exhausted, I didn’t take it in on the Friday” – he made his way to Glastonbury.</p> <p>Watson was offline <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-enforcer-tom-watson-filmed-8284779\">in a silent disco</a> when Corbyn sacked Hilary Benn late that Saturday night, and remained blissfully unaware of the unfolding crisis until he awoke the next morning to a “whole load of missed calls and texts”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1/0_102_625_870/359.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Watson/Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Laura_K_Hughes/status/746992729100541952?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">spent the day on the phone</a>, hurrying back to London, “trying to find out what was happening”. Remarkably, he didn’t speak to Corbyn. Did he even try? “I can’t remember, actually,” he offers vaguely. I’m not sure which would be more bizarre: Corbyn refusing to take his deputy’s call, or Watson not even bothering to phone. When they met the next day, “As ever with Jeremy, it was business-like and friendly.” Watson told him the resignations could have been prevented, had Corbyn only reached out to his shadow team and addressed their concerns. Corbyn disagreed, convinced it was a premeditated coup. “He didn’t seem angry. Just puzzled and sorrowful.”</p> <p>When Watson heard that a no-confidence motion had been tabled, “I didn’t pay it much heed. I thought it wouldn’t have legs.” He won’t say which way he voted, but the result came as a shock. Even then, it didn’t occur to him that Corbyn would defy the PLP’s indictment. “I thought he would realise that to lose the confidence of 80% of your MPs means that you can’t lead the Labour party.” Watson tried to say so in private two days later, but was thwarted when two Corbyn aides made an unscheduled appearance in their car.</p> <p>“I was told we would have the journey on our own, and they came. I did suggest that they didn’t, and they said we’re coming in the car. So it became very difficult to have the conversation.” Was he angry? Watson looks conflicted. “You know, at any point in time I want to put my arms around him and hug him and say it’s going to be all right, but also sort of shout and say, we need to talk about this. So I was actually feeling great sorrow for him.”</p> <p>It wasn’t until six days after the no-confidence vote that Watson met Corbyn privately. “It was very sad, really. But it was also, as ever, polite. I said, I don’t think you can lead the Labour party if you’ve lost 80% of your MPs, and he said, well, look, you’ve said what you have to say, and thank you for saying it. I think he actually said, thank you for saying it in such a polite way. It was still friendly. I did my duty. I did what I could. What else can you do?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9/0_138_4864_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He answers his own question minutes later, after protestations of reluctance that may or not be genuine. His plans “are at a nascent stage”, he says several times, “and I probably shouldn’t even begin to talk to Decca Aitkenhead of the Guardian about them”. But he does.</p> <p>Watson wants to reverse Ed Miliband’s “terrible error of judgment” and reinstate the old electoral college system, which accorded one-third of the votes in a leadership election to the PLP and a third each to the unions and the members. He is also drawing up proposals for an agreement “to have women holding some of the key offices of state. My personal view is if you don’t give a proper gender representation on the frontbench you’re in trouble, and either Owen or Jeremy will have to make sure that those big offices have women in them.”</p> <p>Most significantly, Watson wants to reintroduce elections to the shadow cabinet. Is he sure that MPs who resigned, or refused to serve under Corbyn, would reconsider if elected by the PLP? “I have no idea. But I think if Owen wins it’s still important to do it, because a new leader has got to reshape and rebuild the PLP, and that means giving respect and dignity back to a lot of colleagues.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db/0_290_5672_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much time he will have to effect any of this is uncertain, if Watson is right about his next point. “I think it’s highly likely there’ll be an early election. I mean, if you’re Theresa May, with a majority of 12, with your Brexit fanatics already saying you’re not going quickly enough to get us out of the European Union, with having sacked too many people from the frontbench who are just looking for the opportunity for her to stumble, and with a double-digit lead in the polls, then even though on day one you might not think you’re going to have an early election, I think it’s almost inevitable you’ll get to a point where you have to. If you were Theresa May, why wouldn’t you? Honestly, why wouldn’t you? You’d get your own mandate, you’d have the easiest run at the election you could imagine, and in all likelihood you’d come back with a bigger majority. Why wouldn’t you do that?”</p> <p>Could whoever wins the leadership election survive a defeat in a general election? “Well, I don’t know. I don’t know. I mean, it’s highly unlikely, isn’t it? Most leaders resign after losing an election.” Most leaders, I point out, resign after losing the confidence of 80% of MPs. “Well, yes. So it’s still possible, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Watson is conspicuously reluctant to apportion blame for the crisis facing Labour, but when pressed, he acknowledges, “There are Trots that have come back to the party, and they certainly don’t have the best interests of the Labour party at heart. They see the Labour party as a vehicle for revolutionary socialism, and they’re not remotely interested in winning elections, and that’s a problem. But I don’t think the vast majority of people that have joined the Labour party and have been mobilised by the people that are in Momentum are all Trots and Bolsheviks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505/0_25_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Some months ago, I described Momentum as ‘a bit of a rabble’, and although leading lights in Momentum privately acknowledged to me that they were a bit of a rabble, it caused great offence to everyone that had signed up to Momentum. Some of these people are deeply interested in political change, in building a more equal society, and are just on a journey in politics that they’re new to, and I don’t want them to feel that I’m labelling them because I’m not. But there are some old hands twisting young arms in this process, and I’m under no illusions about what’s going on. They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that’s how Trotsky entryists operate. Sooner or later, that always end up in disaster. It always ends up destroying the institutions that are vulnerable, unless you deal with it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/tom-watson-the-canny-peacemaker-combatting-conspiracy-theorists\">Tom Watson: the canny peacemaker combatting conspiracy theorists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What can Watson say to Guardian readers angry with him for betraying the mandate party members invested in him to serve as a loyal deputy to the leader they elected? By asking Corbyn to stand down, didn’t Watson serve the will of self-important MPs instead?</p> <p>“I don’t think many Guardian readers would think that. I hope most Guardian readers would have a modicum of sympathy for the situation I find myself in. I don’t want us to be here. I don’t want us to be in this position. I didn’t want Hilary to be sacked. I didn’t want there to be a whole set of resignations. I didn’t want us to be 16 points behind in the polls. I didn’t want any of this. I’m not in control of events, but I’m doing what I can.”</p> <p>He is adamant that the party will not split in the event of Corbyn’s re-election. “I don’t know of any MPs who think the party should split, and frankly I think the claim that there’s a plan out there to split the party is propaganda which actually undermines a lot of people in the PLP. Every single person I talk to on the left and right of the party thinks this is a bad idea. I’ve not had anyone muse with me about it. I’ve not had anyone gossip with me about it. I’ve not heard anyone raising it as an issue.”</p> <p>Watson remains in contact with Corbyn, though it sounds rather semi-detached. “We still send the odd text to each other. It’s usually about family stuff, you know. My dad’s ill, and he’s always asking about my dad. My dad’s a big supporter of Jeremy. It’s a sort of chat really.”</p> <p>Such is Watson’s reputation as master of dark arts, some observers have speculated that behind the careful facade of neutrality he is issuing coded messages via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson\">his Twitter feed</a>. In recent weeks, it has become increasingly eccentric, featuring links to months’ old articles, such as one headlined: “Why Bad Ideas Refuse to Die.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/762775167445692418\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s world cat day.

I know it’s my label. But the truth is, I’ve never been a very good fixer. And I couldn’t fix this.”</p>","wordcount":"2073","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T11:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T15:08:38Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T11:30:44Z","internalComposerCode":"57a8a076e4b0f5d064841819","internalOctopusCode":"11790953","internalPageCode":"2639891","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T16:27:55Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

And after Monday’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">high court win and a clean sweep in the elections</a> to Labour’s national executive committee, support for Corbyn shows no signs of abating – despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/762699781546381312?s=09\">continued suggestions</a> that those supporters are nothing more than an abusive rabble. How many of the journalists writing panicked screeds about these awful people have actually met any of them, do you think? I ask because writing about the Corbyn phenomenon over the last year means I’ve met probably hundreds of his supporters and to be honest, I find dealing with them the most pleasant element of writing about Corbyn.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I went to a political event that included a branch of Momentum. All young women; they were energetic, funny and very friendly. Two weeks ago, I had a debate with a Momentum member about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/14/does-jeremy-corbyn-have-a-media-strategy-apparently-not\">Corbyn’s media strategy</a>. Of the two of us, it was me who was the ruder, more impatient one. When Corbyn ran for leadership last year, I visited phone banks for him dozens of times, and spent hours in the company of the very people who went on to found Momentum. I told myself I was <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/11/britains-bernie-sanders-is-about-to-win-big-jeremy-corbyn-labour/\">researching a piece</a>; actually I think I just liked talking to them.</p> <p>Sure, my experiences of these Corbyn supporters might not be representative. But they do suggest that the depiction of them as a madcap bunch of deluded cultists is not representative either. Broadly speaking, the media has failed to understand the political moment in the Labour party; it has shown a damning lack of interest in the fact that people who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands – preferring instead to dismiss them as an angry mob.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People who had previously written off party politics are now flocking towards it in their hundreds of thousands'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One half of that description is accurate, however. Corbyn supporters may not be a mob, but they are angry. And to understand why, it is useful to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/jeremy-gilbert/is-momentum-mob-no-this-is-what-democracy-looks-like\">consider the words</a> of the academic Jeremy Gilbert, a longstanding Labour member and activist who has joined Momentum: “Momentum is simply trying to give a voice to a body of opinion which has been widespread throughout the country for many years, but has been denied any kind of place in our public life since the early days of New Labour. It is a body of opinion which believes, with good reason, that the embrace of neoliberal economics and neoconservative foreign policy under Blair was a disaster … Naturally some of those voices, suppressed for so long, sound raucous, aggressive and uncouth.”</p> <p>The anger that commentators detect in the Corbyn movement, in my experience, is not a symptom of the fact that it has been infiltrated by bullies – but that its members feel as though the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/04/labour-coup-disastrous-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour coup</a> is as much an attack on their right to participate in public discourse as it is on Corbyn.</p> <p>Everything the left traditionally stands for – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\">human rights</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2439714/Ed-Miliband-evil-legacy-wont-apologise.html\">socialism</a> to a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/02/the-iraq-wars- real-victims- laurie-penny- and-the- narcissistic-left/\">foreign policy driven by diplomacy</a> – has been, at best, marginalised and, at worst, actively mocked in mainstream political discourse since the 1970s. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the depiction of the trade unions, the last bastions of organised British socialism, as insidious barons intent on wrecking British life (a claim that sounds particularly ludicrous when made by newspapers who supported the Conservatives at the last election – a party consisting of members of the actual landed gentry).</p> <p>I am yet to meet a single Corbynite who is naive about Corbyn’s failings as a leader, the great challenges he faces, or who does not want to win a general election. But the reason so many have coalesced around him anyway is because they view his leadership as the only opportunity they have had in at least 30 years to see their views finally represented in public life. The Labour rebels’ attempt to unseat him is, in their minds, as much an attempt to excommunicate the wider left as it is to get rid of Corbyn himself. Perhaps the most salient evidence of this is the decision to charge affiliate members £25 to vote in the leadership election, and ban outright members who joined fewer than six months ago – a decision that has now been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules\">overturned in court</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4pd7c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2627517\"            data-video-name=\"Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a06c0ae4b07e27cb7e00e3\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/02/020816Corbyn_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/02/jeremy-corbyn-addresses-thousands-of-supporters-at-liverpool-rally-video\">Jeremy Corbyn addresses thousands of supporters at Liverpool rally – video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Worse still for Corbyn supporters, the policy positions they have taken over the last 30 years have often been proven right. Lack of social housing has led to a spiralling housing crisis; the deregulation of the financial industry would have caused economic collapse had it not been for state intervention; queasiness around public ownership has caused escalating transport costs and arguably the shambles that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/aug/08/southern-rail-strike-begins-live-updates\">Southern Railway</a>; inequality is the UK’s most pressing social issue; a reluctance to rein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels\">fossil fuel companies</a> has led to a climate emergency; and even Tony Blair accepts that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/25/tony-blair-sorry-iraq-war-mistakes-admits-conflict-role-in-rise-of-isis\">Iraq war may have led to the rise of Isis</a>. This is why so many Corbyn supporters are upset by the coup, and why they have decided to back him unequivocally, in spite of the incompetence that has at times been part of his leadership.</p> <p>I have a lot of sympathy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/owen-smith-plan-low-paid-workers-labour-leadership\">Owen Smith</a> supporters who are horrified by Labour’s poll ratings. But I have zero sympathy with those in the party who have been utterly unwilling to engage with Corbyn supporters, and who have not reflected on why they lost control of their party to someone they so clearly regard as useless. There are simply not enough delusional Leninists in Britain to make up the entirety of Corbyn’s support – these are ordinary British voters who want radical solutions to a growing number of crises.

Now many more members will have the chance to vote in the leadership election, I am today calling for an extension of the timetable so that all members have the opportunity to engage with Jeremy and me before making their choice.”</p> <p>His team said they were also concerned about the logistical challenges of ensuring the 130,000 new members can vote, with ballots due to be sent out next week. Many new members, told they would not be allowed to vote, paid £25 to sign up as a “registered supporter” in a two-day window in July.</p> <p>If Monday’s court judgment is not overturned, the party is expected to have to return their money – and will also have to ensure that members who also signed up as supporters are not accidentally sent two sets of voting papers.</p> <p>The two men will go head to head in a second live hustings event in Gateshead on Thursday. Smith used a speech in Newcastle on Monday to announce a series of new economic policies, including demands that the Treasury bring forward the autumn statement and use it to boost investment to prevent a downturn in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf3b35e337ce386fd6319bfb2b9f91202b470553\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf3b35e337ce386fd6319bfb2b9f91202b470553/350_450_2798_1678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith are competing to be Labour leader.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith are competing to be Labour leader.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also reiterated his pledge to put the details of whatever deal Britain is offered as it seeks to leave the European Union to the public, in a referendum.</p> <p>“Under the Tories, we face the prospect of our country being the sick man leaving Europe. Jeremy has said we should get on with leaving, I profoundly disagree. I will not allow the UK to fall coughing and spluttering out of the EU door,” he said.</p> <p>The cutoff date for Labour members to vote in the leadership contest was decided at the end of a long and fractious NEC meeting last month. Corbyn had already left to greet supporters outside, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/jeremy-corbyn-wins-right-to-be-defendant-in-leadership-court-case\">clinched the vote to allow him on to the ballot paper</a> without gathering nominations.</p> <p>In yesterday’s written judgment on the six-month cutoff point, Mr Justice Hickinbottom said: “At the time each of the claimants joined the party, it was the common understanding as reflected in the rule book that, if they joined the party prior to the election process commencing, as new members they would be entitled to vote in any leadership contest. That was the basis upon which each claimant joined the party; and the basis upon which they entered into the contract between members. For those reasons, the claimants’ claim succeeds.”</p> <p>He said that a refusal to allow them to vote was an unlawful breach of contract.</p> <p>The five Labour members who brought the case, whose legal fees were <a href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.co.uk/case/labour-party-membership/\">crowdfunded</a>, had claimed that Labour’s rulebook made no provision for treating them differently and none had ever been made in any of the party’s previous leadership elections.</p> <p>They also argued that when they joined, the Labour website and other communications said they would be “a key part of the team”, and thus eligible to vote in any leadership election.</p> <p>Four named members challenged the decision: Christine Evangelou, the Rev Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham and Chris Granger. The fifth was named in the court papers only as FM because he is under 18.</p> <p>Both Corbyn’s supporters and his opponents had been actively recruiting party members in recent months, helping Labour’s membership rise to more than 500,000 – higher than the peak under Tony Blair.

partly through a 1% rise in corporation tax and bringing back the 50p top rate of tax, the party has said.</p> <p>The office of the leader of the opposition said he wanted to end “unfair and politically motivated public sector pay cap” brought in by the former chancellor George Osborne, which restricts rises to 1% a year this parliament.</p> <p>Instead, Labour would make a return to public sector pay agreed through collective bargaining and the evidence of independent pay review bodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

</aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/unions-1-per-cent-pay-rise-public-sector-workers\">Osborne’s 1% cap</a> is predicted to save £5bn over the course of this parliament, but Corbyn’s office said pay rises could be afforded out of the money coming in from an increase in corporation tax and a return to the 50p top rate of tax. It said the policy would also lead to lower housing benefit and in-work benefit claims, lower spending on agency staff, higher income tax and national insurance receipts and a small stimulus to the economy.</p> <p>It comes as Corbyn set out his pitch to older voters in an article for the Sunday Telegraph, calling on them to support Labour if they value public services. </p> <p>In the article, which shows he is making an effort to reach out beyond his core support base, Corbyn said: “Even if you don’t think of Labour as your natural political home, if you value your NHS, care for the elderly, an education system for all and a public transport system that works for its passengers, then it may be time to think again.” </p> <p>He said countless numbers had been let down in the last six years by the “devastation” of public services. And he launched a fresh attack on Southern Railway, saying the poor level of service in recent months proved that the rail industry should be renationalised.</p> <p>It is understood some of Corbyn’s inner circle have been warning him that the party needs to do more to appeal to older voters, after becoming alarmed at polling that shows he is much more popular with the young.</p> <p>In a recent ComRes poll, only 9% of those over 65 thought Corbyn would make a better prime minister than Theresa May; 77% thought May would be better. He fared better with voters aged 18 to 24, of whom 37% thought he would be better than May, compared with 43% believing she would do better.</p> <p>Corbyn is trailing behind May’s Conservatives in the majority of opinion polls. However, he is the strong favourite to win the Labour leadership election in which he is being challenged by the former shadow cabinet minister Owen Smith.</p> <p>He has raced ahead in securing nominations from local party branches this week, with almost 120 endorsements compared with 24 for Smith.</p> <p>In an interview published by the Huffington Post on Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Corbyn</a> suggested it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/07/jeremy-corbyn-could-stay-as-leader-if-labour-loses-next-election\">not inevitable that he would resign as Labour leader,</a> even if the party lost the next election,</p> <p> John McDonnell, shadow chancellor and chair of Corbyn’s leadership campaign, previously said the Labour leader would go if he lost, adding: “Any <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> leader who loses an election usually goes.”<br /></p> <p>But asked by the Huffington Post UK whether he would quit in such a case, Corbyn said: “Look, nothing is inevitable. And let’s not start predicting the results of the next general election, which may be four years away. I’m campaigning for the leadership of the party at the moment, again.</p> <p>“I’m very happy to be doing that. I’ve been travelling the whole of the UK, but we are also doing it in a slightly different way to last year. We are visiting a lot of places we didn’t go to last year because there wasn’t time. We are also using it to campaign more openly and more publicly on how we bring back in communities that have been left behind by the Tories. And the crowds are even bigger than last year.”</p> <p>He has defended the fact that his party is behind the Conservatives in the majority of opinion polls, pointing to a number of byelection wins at council and parliamentary level.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","wordcount":"699","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-10T18:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-07T13:43:22Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T18:44:17Z","internalComposerCode":"57a73afae4b0f5d0648412cd","internalOctopusCode":"11788761","internalPageCode":"2637290","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-07T21:00:19Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Corbyn</a> in Cardiff in the first hustings debate of the Labour leadership campaign.<br /></p> <p>Taking quickfire questions from members, both candidates emphasised the need for party unity but the debate only underlined the deep divisions within Labour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pair exchanged bitter recriminations over the events that led to the leadership contest, with Smith at times heckled and booed.</p> <p>Smith, who resigned from Corbyn’s shadow cabinet before challenging for the leadership, said the Tories were “riding roughshod over us” and argued that he would take Labour into power. When he said he wanted unity, however, he was interrupted by the audience.</p> <p>The challenger pointed out that Corbyn is lagging behind Theresa May in the opinion polls and claimed that Ukip is making inroads in many Labour heartlands.</p> <p>He said that the priority was winning: “It doesn’t mean trading our principles, it means winning to put them into practice – that’s what we have got to do. We are a Labour government in waiting, not a protest movement”. <br /></p> <p>Corbyn responded with criticism of Smith for having been one of the shadow cabinet ministers to resign, before 172 Labour MPs passed a no-confidence vote in their leader.</p> <p>“What I don’t understand is how you can complain about disunity in the party when you and others are the ones who resigned from the shadow cabinet,” Corbyn said, prompting huge cheers from the audience.</p> <p>Smith was interrupted by boos, as he hit back: “Jeremy, I’m not having that because you know … that I wasn’t part of any coup in the Labour party.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/04/jeremy-corbyn-and-owen-smiths-first-hustings-what-our-writers-thought\">Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith's first leadership hustings: our writers' verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another dramatic moment came as Smith repeatedly agreed with Corbyn on a succession of leftwing policies. The Labour leader replied: “Why did you resign then?”</p> <p>Corbyn highlighted the party’s successes since he took over in September last year, including winning the London mayoral election and four byelections, as well as 22 parliamentary votes. “When we work together we win. When we work together we do defeat the Tories,” he said.</p> <p>Addressing Smith, he said: “The party is growing massively in membership: that must stand for something.” <br /></p> <p>In reply, Smith made the case that the party had not done well enough in the local elections and EU referendum.</p> <p>“We’re going backwards, my friend, backwards,” he said, repeating arguments that the party is in crisis and at risk of splitting.</p> <p>Smith said that only the Tories would benefit from a divided Labour party. Those who opposed Corbyn’s leadership should not be labelled “red Tories” but added: “We’re fighting like ferrets in a sack”.</p> <p>The debate became more evenly matched as it moved on to questions about the EU referendum and the economy.<br /></p> <p>Corbyn was defiant about his performance in the referendum campaign, pointing out that he had made more media appearances than the rest of the shadow cabinet put together. But he was heckled as he acknowledged he could have chosen his words more carefully when he said the day after the referendum that article 50 should be triggered straight away.</p> <p>Smith said he was “absolutely clear” he would support a second referendum once the Brexit terms were settled and won cheers when he said Corbyn would struggle to “take the fight to the Tories” on the EU given his long-standing opposition to the bloc.</p> <p>There was little to divide the two men on the economy and their investment plans, with both pitching their stall well to the left of the party under Ed Miliband and his immediate predecessors.</p> <p>Earlier, Corbyn had set out plans for £500bn of capital investment for infrastructure projects and a pledge for full employment, as he set out a 10-point plan for Britain.</p> <p>Smith called for a British “New Deal” and said he would fund infrastructure spending through raising business taxes and borrowing £200bn. The country needed “good old-fashioned socialist policies”, he said, winning a round of applause as he told Corbyn there was much the two men agreed on.</p> <p>On Trident the divide was starker, with Corbyn’s mention of his longstanding opposition to the programme meeting such sustained cheering that the moderator had to start the question again.</p> <p>But Smith was also applauded – by different sections of the audience, as others sat with their arms folded – as he said that he had once opposed Trident, but his views had shifted.</p> <p>On migration – a core issue in many of Labour’s heartlands – Smith said it was something “we need to be proud of” and that it was vital for services such as the NHS, highlighting the international nature of his own family. There should be no targets, he said.</p> <p>Corbyn said that free movement would be a necessary part of any open-market deal for Britain but called for measures to prevent it from affecting wages.</p> <p>Smith’s claim that Corbyn hadn’t been firm enough on antisemitism was met with both groans and cheers, with one audience member shouting “Jews for Jeremy”. </p> <p>Challenged on his use of language that some felt was misogynistic, Smith said he would champion women, guaranteeing all-women shortlists until there was equal representation in parliament, and that at least half the members of his shadow cabinet and at least 50% of great offices of state would be for women.</p> <p>Corbyn pointed out that his shadow cabinet had been more than 50% women but went far wider in his approach. The perception that some jobs were “for” women should end, as should the culture of early-evening drinks that excluded those who had to look after children.</p> <p>“It’s not just about women in boardrooms, women in parliament … its about women in their day-to-day lives,” he said.</p> <p>Earlier Corbyn <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/aug/04/jeremy-corbyn-10-point-vision-britain-labour-split\">brushed off suggestions</a> that the Labour party could split if he remains as leader. Answering questions from the media after the launch of his 10-point plan, he said: “I’m sure no Labour MP would even dream of breaking away from the family of the Labour party, the family of the Labour party that helped to put them into parliament.”</p> <p>His comments followed a warning from Smith on Wednesday that the party could <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/aug/03/labour-leadership-owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-factions\">“bust apart and disappear”</a> if he remained as

Smith, who will enter his first head-to-head debate with Corbyn at a leadership hustings in Cardiff on Thursday evening, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/labour-leadership-owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-factions\">warned this week it was likely</a> that the party would split or even “bust apart and disappear” if Corbyn won.</p> <p>The Labour leader said on Thursday: “I’m sure no Labour MP would even dream of breaking away from the family of the Labour party, the family of the Labour party that helped to put them into parliament.” Cheers from supporters watching the speech drowned out the rest of the answer.</p> <p>Asked about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/labour-shadow-cabinet-resignations-jeremy-corbyn-who-has-gone\">mass resignations from his shadow cabinet</a> that precipitated the leadership challenge, Corbyn again said he expected rebels to fall back into line if he was re-elected.</p> <p>“It’s a very great responsibility to be elected as a Labour MP to represent our party, our movement and its values,” he said. “I will work with anybody in our party in order to ensure that we come together and win a general election for the good of the majority of this country.”</p> <p>While Thursday’s speech, in front of about 60 supporters and members of the media, was officially part of the leadership battle, Corbyn used the chance to launch the 10-point list of his priorities to put to the country. At the centre is a previously-announced plan for £500bn in public spending via a new national investment bank, to help create a hi-tech and green-based economy. Corbyn said this would be financed by a resultant stronger economy and by cracking down on tax evasion.</p> <p>Corbyn said a Labour government under him would pledge to build 1m new homes in its first term, half of them council properties. Other pledges covered more job security at work, a better-funded and wholly public NHS, more spending on education and environmental issues and action to combat inequality and income disparities.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>On foreign policy, he said a Labour government would focus on conflict resolution and human rights, saying his party’s record over the Iraq war meant it must “work for a more peaceful world”.</p> <p>Corbyn concluded: “As we build towards a general election we offer an alternative, a different way of doing things, where you ignore nobody, you forget nobody, you build a sense of inclusion, of decency, and moral respect within our society.”</p> <p>Answering another question, Corbyn shrugged off polls showing his party 14 points behind the Conservatives. “Yes, we are having a leadership campaign and that has probably damaged, temporarily, Labour support,” he said. “But I think the principles I’ve set out today are things [that] will actually appeal to a very wide range of people within our society. I’m very confident that not only is this leadership campaign going to end in a positive result, but our party is going to be stronger, and probably more united at the end of it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/03/labour-leadership-owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-factions\">Labour could 'bust apart and disappear', Smith warns Corbyn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corbyn won the backing of another trade union in the race for the Labour leadership on Thursday. The executive of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association voted unanimously to support Corbyn rather than Smith.</p> <p>Manuel Cortes, the union’s general secretary, said: “Jeremy has a set of policies and values which will benefit working people and we will be backing him on the basis.</p> <p>“From his support for a publicly owned railway, his restoration of workers’ rights, removed by the Tories and not brought back under New Labour, and his commitment to running the economy in the interests of 99% of the people rather than the rich elite as favoured by the Tories, he is offering the country a genuinely radical alternative government.”</p> <p>Earlier, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that a huge programme of investment was needed, which is backed by business groups such as the CBI.</p> <p>Rejecting the idea that the markets would take fright at more borrowing, he said: “It would barely spook the markets if virtually every single independent economic adviser has provided that advice to the government and other European capitals ... When you reach some limits of monetary policy you reach for fiscal stimulus.”</p> <p>On Smith’s warning of a Labour split, McDonnell accused him of attempting to blackmail Corbyn voters into supporting his campaign, and dismissed the claim as the “wrong tactic in a leadership election”. He described the message coming from some of Smith’s friends as a threat and said he did not think that was acceptable.</p> <p>Asked why he did not want Smith as leader, McDonnell said: “Owen is a great guy, I like him a lot. He is one of the most ambitious career politicians I have met. I think we have moved on from that style of politics. The style of politics people want and that attracts them to Jeremy Corbyn is, ‘what you see is what you get – principled, honest, straightforward’.”</p> <p>The decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/25/labour-party-members-abuse-leadership-vote-ian-mcnicol\">bar Labour members who joined after 12 January </a>from voting in the election is being challenged in the high court, in a crowdfunded case brought by some of the estimated 130,000 people who have been excluded.</p> <h2>Corbyn’s 10 pledges</h2> <ol> <li>Full employment and an economy that works for all: based around a £500bn public investment via the planned national investment bank.</li> <li>A secure homes guarantee: building 1m new homes in five years, at least half of them council homes. Also rent controls and secure tenancies.</li> <li>Security at work: includes stronger employment rights, an end to zero hours contracts and mandatory collective bargaining for companies with 250 or more employees.</li> <li>Secure our NHS and social care: end health service privatisation and bring services into a “secure, publicly-provided NHS”.</li> <li>A national education service: includes universal public childcare, the “progressive restoration” of free education, and quality apprenticeships.</li> <li>Action to secure our environment: includes keeping to Paris climate agreement, and moving to a “low-carbon economy” and green industries, in part via national investment bank.</li> <li>Put the public back into our economy and services: includes renationalising railways and bringing private bus, leisure and sports facilities back into local government control.</li> <li>Cut income and wealth inequality: make a progressive tax system so highest earners are “fairly taxed”, shrink the gap between the highest and lowest paid.</li> <li>Action to secure an equal society: includes action to combat violence against women, as well as discrimination based on race, sexuality or disability, and defend the Human Rights Act.</li> <li> Peace and justice at the heart of foreign policy: aims to put conflict resolution and human rights “at the heart of foreign policy”.</li>
