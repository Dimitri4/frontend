You would be amazed,” he said. “They know they can come here and reveal themselves without people thinking they’re mental. I don’t have customers who have been Harry Potterfied.” </p> <p>Rowling tweeted in response on Sunday: “Oh yeah? Well, I don’t think they’re real wands.” Her comment was liked by more than 15,000 people, but some criticised her on Twitter for making fun of pagan religions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/764756755368800256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oh yeah?

Thompson&#39;s widow, Anita (second to left), returned a pair of stolen elk antlers to the home of Ernest Hemingway in Ketchum, Idaho last week. The late writer stole the antlers from Hemingway’s home while on assignment for the National Observer in 1964. The antlers have hung at the Thompson&#39;s Owl Farm home in Woody Creek for the last 52 years. “Hunter later regretted this,” Anita wrote in an e-mail Sunday. “Hunter and I planned to take a road trip back to Ketchum and quietly return them. But we never did.” • #aspen #aspentimes #pitkincounty #colorado #local #news #hunterthompson #owlfarm #woodycreek #gonzo #journalism #ernesthemingway #literature #ketchum #idaho @natobserver</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by aspentimes (@aspentimes) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2016-08-10T18:51:48+00:00\">Aug 10, 2016 at 11:51am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Anita Thompson told Brandon Wenerd at BroBible that her late husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">who killed himself in 2005</a>, “had so much respect for Hemingway” and “was actually very embarrassed” by his actions.</p> <p>The couple had “planned to take a road trip and quietly return them, and not make a thing of it”, she said, but never did. This year, she got in touch with the Hemingway family, and earlier this month drove the antlers back to Ketchum – now owned by charity <a href=\"http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/idaho/placesweprotect/hemingway-preserve.xml\">the Nature Conservancy</a> – herself.</p> <p>“They were warm and kind of tickled … they were so open and grateful, there was no weirdness,” she told Wenerd, a long-time friend, of the Hemingway family’s reaction. “Still, it’s something that was stolen from the home. They were grateful to have them back. They had heard rumours. Sean Hemingway, the grandson, was the first family member that I’d heard from. He spoke with other Hemingway family members and he said that everyone agreed that he should have them. He lives in New York, where he curates a museum. So now that I’m back from Ketchum we’re actually shipping them to Sean.”</p> <p><em>• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

It’s as if concepts from organic chemistry were compressed into a Dutch genre painting depicting a scuzzy backyard in industrial New Jersey. Feinman’s awareness of the systems underlying observable phenomena is striking: he selects and deploys his images brilliantly, but the poem is often more structuralist than imagist.<br /></p> <p> It’s one of a batch of 39 previously unpublished poems written during the 1950s and now included in <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10686.html\">Corrupted into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman</a>. It’s a riveting collection by a poet who deserves to be better known. The problem is that Feinman published very little during his life: there was Preambles and Other Poems (OUP, 1964), which was then published with revisions as Poems by Princeton in 1990. The rest was a pointed silence.</p> <p> All the newly published poems are those of a young man, but they are in no way beginner’s pieces. Usefully for the new reader, they clarify some of Feinman’s preoccupations and affinities. He was never a Beat or a confessional poet: his early mentors were Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens. James Geary, editor of the previously unseen section of the book, and one-time student of Feinman, recalls that the Brooklyn-born college lecturer came from a long line of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews\">Litvak</a> Talmudic scholars. When he taught Milton, he approached the work as sacred text. </p> <p> Regarding his own poetry, Feinman was deeply humble, and even distrustful. The world might have been the problem, rather than the unreliable ways of words. The poem preceding Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is called Lament for the Coming of Spring, and coins the grimly memorable phrase, “helic hate”. Feinman’s “songs” are unconsoling and some seem inconsolable.</p> <p> This week’s poem begins: “The sun beating on his brain.” This “beating” may be creatively enriching; it’s certainly more benign than helic hate. “Brain” occurs three times in the poem, almost like a form of linguistic punctuation (there’s no conventional punctuation). Sun, cat, woodpile and flies surround this unnervingly exposed brain, the life cycles resembling a <a href=\"http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html\">Yeatsian gyre</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/09/poem-of-the-week-wb-yeats\">Poem of the week: The Sorrow of Love by WB Yeats</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Yeats was important to Feinman. He’s present not only in the copper-fastened craft but in the way Feinman turns a beggared space into a repository of the more-than-temporal. It’s also possible that Feinman is following up a strand of Yeatsian mysticism with the puzzling assertion, “He holds three eternal parameters”. Could this be a reference to the Hindu concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%E1%B9%87a\">the Three Gunas</a>? </p> <p>The same phrase is <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMhwx6BTwQcC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=what+are+the+three+eternal+parameters?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XIjKw2a7PB&amp;sig=i0TeyhJb1LkT5FW4oNSeO6i51UA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW-5ya-rjOAhUsDsAKHcNGAqsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20are%20the%20three%20eternal%20parameters%3F&amp;f=false\">used by Dr S S Bhatti</a>, referring to the three architectural principles of the cosmos, Brahma (creation), Vishnu (sustenance) and Mahesh (destruction).</p> <p>Alvin’s sun, cat, man, woodpile and flies may represent these qualities, or partake of their symbolism to some degree: the human brain embodies (“holds”) them all. </p> <p> But Feinman moves quickly on from his parameters to matters of perception: “The habit of his eye repeats / The shapes he reifies.” The possessive pronoun here could refer to the cat but more probably refers to the protagonist summoned at the poem’s start. We know that the mages we see enter the retina in two dimensions, but are “translated” into three by the brain. If this is what “the habit of his eye” and the “shapes he reifies” allude to, perhaps the “eternal parameters” triplicate foreshadows the three dimensions. </p> <p> The thought may be structuralist but the sounds are sensuous: we can hear the flies buzzing in the word “nauseous”, though it seems a transferred epithet: flies vomit as part of their digestive process and it’s not very likely that hot weather makes them feel sick. These lines have a dense murmur and dazzle like that of the hot backyard. </p> <p> The next two lines are isolated and fill the space around them with sombre, or at least fatalistic, portent. There’s a striking contrast between “silence” (a kind of negative image, a whiteness, with the power of salving “its own ache”) and “the plenum of a small red brain”. The blood-suffused brain-colour is significant, connecting intelligence to what is “red in tooth and claw”. Perhaps, too, because the brain is seen as <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plenum\">a plenum</a>, the poem is telling us that there’s no way out of our own perception. The brain fits flush to the skull. Consciousness is basically organic structure and scarily inescapable.</p> <p> Decay is inherent in all this sun-bred life. The woodpile declines to “sticks”, the flies, since they “fall suppurant”, must have succumbed to swat or insecticide or natural death. Meanwhile the cat, stirred from its “slouching” doze, is ready for some action. The sensed distinction between cosmic, perhaps God-like creation using space and time, and the small mammalian attempt, which is the product of illusory mental freedom, and merely reproductive, seems to drag the poem back as it heaves itself towards a positive conclusion. The penultimate stanza (the most difficult two lines in a difficult poem) imagine, I think, free will and limitless action, almost conceive them as possibilities. But the optimism is scarred, and will be deeply qualified by that repeated “as though”. The glittering fact remains: the poem’s sonnet-size contains all the space and sun required for Feinman to shape and “make a world”.</p> <ul> <li>Backyard, Hoboken, Summer is excerpted from Corrupted Into Song: The Complete Poems of Alvin Feinman by Alvin Feinman. © 2016 Princeton University Press.

celebrates his close friend’s sharp curiosity about nature, 10 years after his death","byline":"Terence Blacker","body":"<p>Swimming in the river Waveney on a sunny afternoon last weekend, it was difficult not to think of my good friend and neighbour Roger Deakin who died 10 years ago next Friday.</p> <p>Roger was an unusual man – wild, strong, uncompromising in the way he lived his life, with a sharp curiosity about nature and people. He was terrific, funny company and a loyal friend. With his first book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/waterlog-2.html\"><em>Waterlog</em></a>, subtitled “A swimmer’s journey through Britain”, he found the perfect form for his view of the world: clear-eyed; subversive; informed; full of a sense of wonder but with a tug of melancholy beneath the surface of the prose.</p> <p>The book’s originality and charm found many readers, and Roger, who was never a vain man, reacted to its success with startled pleasure, rather as if an otter had made a surprise appearance at his moat.</p> <p>It seemed that a great, late-blooming literary career lay ahead of him, but he died from a brain tumour before his second book, <em>Wildwood</em>, was published. A book based on his notebooks, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/notes-from-walnut-tree-farm.html\"><em>Notes from Walnut Tree Farm</em></a>, was brought out in 2008.</p> <p>Soon after his death, it became clear that it was not just Roger’s writing that appealed to readers across the world; it was his character, his attitude to the environment, the way he lived, what he was thought to represent.</p> <p>Essays and editorials were published in praise of him. He was said to be a pioneer of something called “new nature writing”. A one-man play about him was written. There was talk of a book – “not so much a biography as a celebration”.</p> <p>Then there was the backlash. There have been brutally funny parodies of the style of writing Roger is thought to have influenced. New nature has been dismissed as a marketing wheeze.</p> <p>Maybe this grim process of chatter and myth-making is inevitable when a distinctive writer dies before his or her time. It must have happened with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\">Plath</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/bruce-chatwin\">Chatwin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\">Foster Wallace</a> and others. But the effect it has is to smooth off the interesting rough corners of a life, replacing a real, complicated person with a shiny icon. It is my small personal wish that Roger’s books will be read by even more people over the next decade, but without the attendant noise and silliness of literary celebrity.</p>","wordcount":"389","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-18T16:33:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qetp","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cfb511b02622dccf2a972d8956d5103fdd9bb5/141_649_2080_1247/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/booksblog","type":"blog","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books

Now help us choose the winner","byline":"Sam Jordison","body":"<p>The votes are in – record number of them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/02/not-the-booker-prize-very-longlist-2016-votes-please\">More than 1,500 have been cast in this year’s competition</a>. That’s impressive enough in itself – but even more so when you consider our rules and that more than 1,500 reviews have also been written, and more than 1,500 second preference votes also cast. So despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jul/18/not-the-booker-prize-2016-vote-for-your-favourite-book-of-the-year#img-1\">the really very modest prize on offer</a>, our uniquely democratic judging process (any reader can help decide) seems to be attracting growing interest.</p> <p>I’m happy to say that – as far as I know – it has been a relatively orderly and respectable process this year. There have been a few accusations of entryism and outside pressure, but it wouldn’t be a proper election without some controversy, and I’d say we’re doing much better than most. Not least because we know have an interesting and unusual group of books to consider. Here’s our current top six, chosen from the 147 books longlisted, ranked by number of votes:</p> <p><a href=\"https://equuspress.wordpress.com/the-combinations/\">The Combinations by Louis Armand</a> (Equus) – 123</p> <p><a href=\"https://bluemoosebooks.com/books/less-than-perfect-legend-of-donna-creosote\">The Less Than Perfect Legend of Donna Creosote by Dan Micklethwaite</a> (Bluemoose Books) – 101</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freightbooks.co.uk/walking-the-lights-by-deborah-andrews.html\">Walking the Lights by Deborah Andrews</a> (Freight Books) – 99</p> <p><a href=\"http://scribepublications.co.uk/books-authors/books/the-summer-that-melted-everything/\">The Summer That Melted Everything by Tiffany McDaniel</a> (Scribe) – 98</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.watsonlittle.com/book/chains-of-sand/\">Chains of Sand by Jemma Wayne</a> (Legend Press) – 80</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.silvertailbooks.com/portfolio-post/what-will-remain/\">What Will Remain by Dan Clements</a> (Silvertail) – 61</p> <p>It’s going to be intriguing to see how those votes get turned around as we move through the competition.<br /></p> <p>At this stage in the proceedings, I generally like to complain about how much the counting has made my head hurt, but this time, I can’t. All credit for battling through those votes has to go to Lisa L Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/tips-links-and-suggestions-books\">a TLS stalwart</a> and all-conquering spreadsheet hero. She’s done all the hard work, in close consultation with me about rules and eligibility, and I can’t thank her enough. </p> <p>I also have to thank everyone who voted and contributed: it’s already a bumper year and that’s a fine feeling. I hope you aren’t too upset if your favourite book didn’t get through, and that you’ll stay with us through the rest of the competition as we see how those that did make it on to the list measure up.</p> <p>On the subject of those books, many of them are entirely new to me, and I’m guessing to most other readers too. That always makes things more exciting. It’s also good to see that we’ve got a 50/50 split when it comes to gender, as well as an all-independent set of finalists. I know something about one or two of the authors, but at this stage I won’t make any comment as I’ll be hoping to take each book on its own merits.</p> <p>On that subject, I’ll be posting reviews just-about-weekly from now on, building up to <strong>our call for votes on 17 October</strong>. I’ll read in reverse alphabetical order, just to shake things up a little. Some of you will have realised that this means we’ll start with Jemma Wayne’s Chains of Sand. I hope you’ll join me in reading it. </p> <p>I especially hope you’ll join me because, like last year, we’re hoping to find three judges whose opinions will be counted alongside the public vote in the final round. Look out for an article explaining more about that next week. For now, in case you want to jump in and get reading, the relevant section from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/18/terms-and-conditions-for-the-not-the-booker-prize-2016\">our high and mighty terms and conditions</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>11. Three readers will be selected by the Guardian to form a panel of judges from those readers who have made substantial contributions to the discussion of the shortlisted books. The process by which these readers are chosen is left studiously vague and is at the Guardian’s discretion. These judges undertake to read at least three of the six-book shortlist before the final judging meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p>And now we can get to the best bit: the actual reading of actual books.

Kellaway","body":"<p>How often is a poetry collection a collection? It is a rare thing for every poem to get on with its neighbours, but one of the pleasures of reading Katharine Towers’s beautiful poems is that they belong together. I kept thinking, as I read, of Shakespeare’s word for herbs and flowers: “simples”. These are simples, remedies for the eye and mind. And yet the opening poem, The Roses, is an unusual mixture of peace and violent emotion. The roses are the medium through which Towers remembers her father and conjures him for an impossible, unpruned moment, back to life. Later in the collection – the two poems placed like symmetrical windows – she imagines her mother alive, only to let her go and, in a sense, become her mother herself – part of what it is to mourn a parent.</p> <p>This is Towers’s second collection (her first was longlisted for the <em>Guardian’s</em> first book award). And there is so much to praise about the writing: clarity, generosity and grace. There are no barriers between poem and reader. Individual verbs give a frisson of pleasure because they are exactly right: frost “enunciates” the day, an enormous cloud “lolled” against a hill, the sea is “rummaging” to find weaknesses in the cliff. She knows less is more. Reading between the lines is our fine task, listening to what is not quite spoken. And as a linguist (there are a couple of splendid poems about translation) she is interested in the limbo between languages, the teasing nature of the apparently inexpressible.</p> <p>She writes with a marvellously gentle wit and a metrical intelligence. I particularly love her poem Chaffinch. The bird emerges as an inferior but admirably persistent artist (one knows the sort of chap she is talking about):</p> <p><em>… and no-one has told him</em><br /><em>he always sounds the same.</em><br /><em>Never bored, he understands</em><br /><em>that moments must be uttered</em><br /><em>and moments do not matter –</em></p> <p>She may be ribbing the bird but also identifies the unfashionable truth about time he embodies. She is alive to the liberties poets take in appropriating nature and seems on the edge of applying a restraining hand to her own pen – fortunately never succeeding in silencing herself. In Murmuration, a wonderful poem about starlings, she reflects as she watches their flight: “none of this is about us”. In Childhood, a breathtaking song of innocence and experience, she interrogates scrutiny: “We should not be looking so hard/at what a tree would rather keep to itself”. And in Bluebells, she reflects on the way that flowers have no choice but to return each year and be blue. Whatever a poet makes of them, they are helplessly themselves.</p> <p>This may explain the book’s provocatively fanciful core in which she takes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/sep/01/shopping\" title=\"\">Dr Bach’s 1930s flower remedies</a> and imagines how it would be were each flower or plant afflicted with the malaise it was intended to cure. It is another way of defying what human beings have imposed and, in less skilful hands, might have been a whimsical disaster. But these poems, each written in the first person – Agrimony, Aspen, Water Violet, Early Gentian and many more – are a joy. I particularly love Willow, said to be a “remedy for self-pity”. For the willow: “water is always upon me/like a bad thought./For all the good I have not done… Forgive me, forgive me.” Quite how she manages the balancing act between entertainment and something that comes close to a prayer, that catches at your throat, is beyond me.</p> <h2>Childhood by Katharine Towers<br /></h2> <p>These criss-cross lines printed on the snow<br />are bones of trees laid bare by the moon.<br />We should not be looking so hard</p> <p>at what a tree would rather keep to itself.<br />Would we not fear to be shown<br />how like replicas we are, and how mechanical?</p> <p>Let’s play that game again, stepping out<br />along the branches – pretending to tip –<br />as if we still believed we couldn’t fall.</p> <p><em>The Remedies by Katharine Towers is published by Picador

reader","byline":"Sarah Marsh","body":"<p>I came across Cheryl Strayed’s Wild during a difficult patch last year. Without going into too much detail, a perfect storm of life events left me anxious and depressed. I remember doing all the things you are supposed to do to get better: exercising, meditating – and reading, which brought me to this book. When my anxious mind refused to concentrate on TV or music, Strayed’s account of her 1,100-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail transported me out of myself, made me feel less alone, and more hopeful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/26/cheryl-strayed-interview-wild-reese-witherspoon-feminist\">Walk on the Wild side: Cheryl Strayed’s 1,000-mile hike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wild begins in the hospital ward where, at just 22, Strayed lost her mother to lung cancer. “She would always be the empty bowl that no one could full,” Strayed writes. “I’d have to fill it myself again and again and again.” The sheer weight of this loss sets her on a downward spiral of self-destruction: her family is broken and scattered, her marriage breaks down, she develops a heroin addiction. Four years on from her mother’s death, she is desperate to find a way back to the person she once was, flinging herself into a journey across America.</p> <p>Through her epic walk, Strayed tests herself both physically and mentally, and with every demonstration of her own resilience is able to open herself up to life once more; the journey teaches her survival skills beyond those used on a hike. Her internal struggles and emerging strengths mirror her developing physical prowess, proving the vital link between mind and body.</p> <p>Much of the comfort of Wild stems from the honesty of Strayed’s voice: she is naive, warm, in pain. You want her to achieve what she does – as Strayed tentatively peers around every corner, to take on a record snowfall, then snakes, then bears, you will be with her on every page. Some of the best parts of Wild, for me, were the passages where she met other lonely travellers with their own unique stories. I, like her, felt a great relief when she arrived at each camp stop, parched and hungry for warmth, food and company.</p> <p>But for all this worthiness, the book is also, at times, very funny. Strayed is a hiking novice: she hobbles about in too-small shoes, while lugging around about 20lb of water in a dromedary bag. One of the most famous scenes, in both the book and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/wild-review-gritty-portrait-wandering-star-witherspoon-nick-hornby\">the subsequent movie adaptation</a>, sees her repair her tiny boots with duct-tape – only to lose one down the side of a mountain. Even shoeless, Strayed remains undefeated.</p> <p>Literature also played an important role in Strayed’s personal journey. During her travels, she devours book after book. She grows stronger, reading at night the tales of writers who have gone before her – with only a miner’s headlamp to light the page. She is saved, in part, by the power of words and shared experience. </p> <p>In much the same way, I found her words building me up. The end of the book, without giving too much away, is poignant, thoughtful and perfectly rounds off the narrative. Reading Wild helped me realise that every step forward is a step into a new future, new hope and new opportunity.

Together with some essential volumes of poetry (see Nos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/22/100-best-nonfiction-books-birthday-letters-ted-hughes-sylvia-plath\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/11/100-best-nonfiction-books-11--seamus-heaney-north-poetry\">11</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/23/arielsylvia-plath-100-best-nonfiction-books-robert-mccrum\">17</a>), this extraordinary drama would not only exert a profound influence on the postwar imagination, it would provide a metaphor for existence. Arguably, the great plays and poetry identified by this series transcend their genres to contribute tangibly to our sense of “who we are”, the guiding principle of this list. (I will return to the contentious question of what exactly the non-genre of nonfiction really is. That, of course, is where the trouble starts. Fiction is a genre. Nonfiction is a library convention; its definition is nebulous. Perhaps by the time this list is complete we’ll have a better idea about its constituent elements.)</p> <p>Thus, from the moment Vladimir and Estragon step on to an empty stage furnished with nothing more than a bare tree and utter the famous opening line: “Nothing to be done”, the audience is pitched into a world in which the idea of boredom becomes a prolonged metaphor about the nature of existence, a strangely entertaining and finally moving “tragicomedy” (the author’s description) sustained by two tramps in vaudeville costume and the ever-absent “Mr Godot.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The circumstances of Waiting for Godot are bleak, but the experience for the audience can be of optimism, often hilarity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The author of <em>En Attendant Godot</em> was certainly a member of the European avant garde, but an unlikely theatrical innovator. Beckett had never written a staged play before. Born in Dublin on Good Friday, 1906, Beckett had moved to Paris as a young man to sit at the feet of James Joyce, whose secretary and amanuensis he briefly became.</p> <p>Between the wars, Beckett developed his genius as a writer in the shadow of modernism and, closer to home, <em>Ulysses</em> and <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. His first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/17/100-best-novels-murphy-samuel-beckett-no-61-observer-guardian\"><em>Murphy</em></a>, rejected many times, was finally published in 1938, coincidentally the same year as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/10/100-best-novels-scoop-evelyn-waugh-robert-mccrum\"><em>Scoop</em></a> (Evelyn Waugh) and <em>The Code of the Woosters</em> (PG Wodehouse). It opened with a brilliantly alienated first line – “The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new” – puzzled a lot of reviewers, was praised by Dylan Thomas and sold very badly.</p> <p>Then the war came, and the Nazi panzers rolled into Paris. Beckett fled south and lived for part of the war as a near vagrant and possible resistance fighter, in and around Roussillon. Returning to Paris after the liberation in 1944, he published a brilliant trilogy (<em>Molloy</em>, <em>Malone Dies</em>, <em>The Unnamable</em>) and established a modest reputation as a writer’s writer, an avant gardist with a quirky wit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1262dd85bc405244cffc2b63b1f192ec07afff45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1262dd85bc405244cffc2b63b1f192ec07afff45/0_0_2575_3562/723.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel Beckett, circa 1950.\" width=\"723\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel Beckett, circa 1950.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He wrote <em>En Attendant Godot</em> in French and it received its premiere in Paris at the Théâtre de Babylone on 5 January 1953 [see chronological note, below]. The common view that it flopped is disputed by the record. James Knowlson’s and Deidre Bair’s biographies (<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/damned-to-fame.html\"><em>Damned to Fame</em></a> (1996) and <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/samuel-beckett/deirdre-bair/9780671691738\"><em>Samuel Beckett: A Biography</em></a> (1978) confirm that, actually, the play, which was produced on a shoestring with a scratch cast, did quite well, with some favourable reviews.</p> <p>The text of the play, now in Beckett’s translation, crossed the Channel and landed on the desk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/24/theatre.beckettat100\">young director Peter Hall</a> who, admitting that he hadn’t “the foggiest idea” what it meant, produced it at the Arts Theatre, London in August 1955. Almost immediately, the two most influential London critics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jan/10/theatre2\">Kenneth Tynan</a> (the <em>Observer</em>) and Harold Hobson (the <em>Sunday Times</em>) hailed it as a masterpiece.</p> <p>Within the decade, Beckett was established as the most innovative, radical and important English-language playwright of the century, one of the founding fathers of the theatre of the absurd. Eventually, his work would profoundly influence the work of Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, David Mamet and Sam Shepard, among many others.</p> <p>The circumstances of <em>Waiting for Godot</em> are bleak and existential, but the main characters, “Didi” and “Gogo”, exhibit a manic energy and utter dialogue of such entrancing polyphony, laced with moments of profound and resonant silence, that the experience for the audience can be a mood of optimism and often hilarity. Beckett’s vision might be dark, but his touch is supremely light. Some snatches of the dialogue are more Laurel and Hardy than Kafka:</p> <blockquote> <p>VLADIMIR: I don’t understand. <br />ESTRAGON: Use your intelligence, can’t you? <br /><em>Vladimir uses his intelligence. </em><br />VLADIMIR: (<em>finally</em>) I remain in the dark.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tellingly, his characters acknowledge their part in the illusion of action that’s unfolding in front of us:</p> <blockquote> <p>ESTRAGON: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?<br />VLADIMIR: Yes, yes, we’re magicians.</p> </blockquote> <p>The tramps also delight in teasing each other, and the audience, with their predicament:</p> <blockquote> <p>ESTRAGON: I can’t go on like this.<br />VLADIMIR: That’s what you think.</p> </blockquote> <p>Time hangs both light and heavy. Occasionally, the waiting becomes too much. Pozzo, who has gone blind in the course of the action, can stand it no longer:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jul/07/samuel-beckett-the-maestro-of-failure\">Samuel Beckett, the maestro of failure</a> </p> </aside>  <blockquote> <p>POZZO: (<em>suddenly furious.</em>) Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed time! It’s abominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we’ll go deaf, one day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for you? (<em>Calmer.</em>) They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it’s night once more.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later, towards the end of act two, Vladimir, the more reflective of the two tramps, will pick up this speech, and play with it in another passage of great beauty characteristic of Beckett’s prose:</p> <blockquote> <p>Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave-digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries. (<em>He listens.</em>) But habit is a great deadener.</p> </blockquote> <p>For Beckett, the examined life is both the beginning, and the end, of the human comedy:</p> <blockquote> <p>VLADIMIR: What do they say?<br />ESTRAGON: They talk about their lives.<br />VLADIMIR: To have lived is not enough for them.<br />ESTRAGON: They have to talk about it.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Waiting for Godot</em> has been debated about for more than 60 years now. The elusive Godot himself, most notably, has been the object of intense, and occasionally deranged, speculation. Beckett was offhand about his “meaning”. In Deidre Bair’s controversial biography, he is quoted, saying that it would be “fatuous of me to pretend that I am not aware of the meanings attached to the word ‘Godot’, and the opinion of many that it means ‘God’.” He was, however, insistent that “I wrote the play in French, and if I did have that meaning in my mind, it was somewhere in my unconscious and I was not overtly aware of it.”</p> <p>For such speculation, Beckett has an answer, in one of Vladimir’s great speeches:</p> <blockquote> <p>VLADIMIR: Let us not waste time in idle discourse! (<em>Pause. Vehemently.</em>) Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? (<em>Estragon says nothing.</em>) It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in the immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come – </p> </blockquote> <p>And of course, at the end of act two, with no sign of Godot, none of this has come to anything.</p> <blockquote> <p>VLADIMIR: Well ? Shall we go ?<br />ESTRAGON: Yes, let’s go.<br />They do not move.</p> </blockquote> <h2>A signature sentence<br /></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“When!

Beckett sent an introductory note in which he confessed: “I don’t know who Godot is”, but did not himself turn up. The French (Editions Minuit) text appeared in print on 17 October 1952 in advance of the play’s first unabridged theatrical performance. This premiere of Beckett’s French version took place on 5 January 1953 in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris. Beckett’s English translation of his play was published during 1954 by the Grove Press, in the US. The first English language version of Waiting for Godot was premiered in London in 1955 at the Arts Theatre, and was subsequently published in the UK by Faber &amp; Faber in 1956.</em></p> <p><em>Waiting for Godot is available from Faber (£9.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/waiting-for-godot.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order a copy for £8.19 </em></a></p>","wordcount":"1638","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-05T05:30:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4ptcm","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/46043fe17f2e4c54c263b31c13fe67bdce66ab4d/0_126_2800_1680/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"100 Best Nonfiction Books of All Time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum's guide to the 100 greatest nonfiction books in English."},{"id":"culture/beckett","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Samuel Beckett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/beckett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/beckett","references":[]},{"id":"stage/theatre","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webTitle":"Theatre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatre","references":[]},{"id":"stage/stage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webTitle":"Stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/stage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

I suggested he wore potting-shed clothes. In the mid 20th century, an employed gardener might habitually have worked in a tweed jacket, a tie, baggy trousers and a comfortable pullover. So he’d have dressed much like his master except with a little less crease in his trousers and a blunter edge to his lapel. This is just how Orwell looks in all the photos and it’s how I aim to represent him.<br /><strong>Martin Jennings</strong><br /><em>Witney, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>","wordcount":"115","commentable":"false","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qzfz","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f74ff792cf3ddf79fcef874c43eb407d925eb08/0_9_2665_1599/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/georgeorwell","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"George Orwell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/georgeorwell","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/sculpture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Sculpture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/sculpture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/sculpture","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"BBC","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webTitle":"Media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/art","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/art","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Art and design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"tone/letters","type":"tone","webTitle":"Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/letters","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Letters and Leader Writers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","references":[]},{"id":"uk/london","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/london","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"Editorials & reply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"7f74ff792cf3ddf79fcef874c43eb407d925eb08","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f74ff792cf3ddf79fcef874c43eb407d925eb08/0_9_2665_1599/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"George Orwell","caption":"George Orwell.

Charmaine and her husband, Stan, live in their cramped car, having lost their home and jobs in a financial collapse that has turned the north-east of the US into “a festering scrapheap”.</p> <p>Survival is all for our protagonists. People have been reduced to selling their bodies, souls, even their blood. Dystopias have been brilliantly evoked by Atwood, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a> to the MaddAddam trilogy, and her latest pulses with profound questions: what lengths would you go to survive? What compromises would you make? What would make someone kill the thing they most love?</p> <p>One day, Charmaine sees an advert for the Positron Project, promising she “can be the person she’s always wanted to be”. Having barely read the terms and conditions, the couple sign the binding “commitment papers” and relocate to the town of Consilience, “because Charmaine has her heart set on it”. Here is a story showing what desperation does to the human heart.</p> <p>Prohibitions abound here. Everyone must live two lives: one month they have a home and job but the next they must live in a prison, swapping with their “Alternates”. Although there is a “strict Consilience taboo against contact with Alternates”, Charmaine and Stan cannot help imagining alternative lives with alternative partners and are so tantalised by the possibilities that they pursue them to devastating effect.</p> <p>In the tightly controlled environment (where “they censor anything too arousing or disruptive”, including rock music and hip-hop), characters nevertheless lose control, governed by their “tormented desires”.</p> <p>The increasingly bizarre plot takes in subterfuge, sex slaves, human organ trafficking and identity erasure. But it is the details that are most emotionally engaging, as characters cling on to their last vestiges of humanity: the moment, on realising the truth, when “Charmaine’s heart sinks”; the moment her husband’s “heart beats like percussion under her fingertips”; the moment a serial adulterer assures his wife “he’s loyal to her in his heart”.</p> <p>This visceral study of desperation and desire journeys into the dark heart of greed, exploitation and brutality, as it portrays a project that is “an infringement of individual liberties, an attempt at total social control, an insult to the human spirit”. It is filled with passages of great intellectual and emotional acuity, appealing both to the head and to the heart.</p> <p><em> The Heart Goes Last is published by Virago (£8.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/heart-goes-last.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to a copy for £7.37 </em></a></p>","wordcount":"428","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-04T09:45:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4ptgx","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a86944c146b23f09b10b4fdc98dabf0cae0cc9/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/margaretatwood","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Margaret Atwood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/margaretatwood","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/anitasethi","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Anita Sethi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anitasethi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/anitasethi","references":[],"bio":"<p>Anita Sethi is a journalist, writer and broadcaster.

and cons of keeping odd hours","byline":"Alex Clark","body":"<p>Lionel Shriver is the author of 13 novels, including the Orange prize-winning <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/big-brother-lionel-shriver-review\"><em>Big Brother</em></a><em> </em>and her most recent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047-by-lionel-shriver\"><em>The Mandibles</em></a>. She grew up in North Carolina, and now lives in London, with forays to the US, where she was when the <em>Observer </em>spoke to her.</p> <p><strong>You are a seasoned night owl. What’s the story?</strong><br />I gravitate to a schedule whereby I end up going to sleep at about 4am, and I don’t know why exactly. I used to identify <em>Newsnight </em>being broadcast at 10.30pm as the source of all my ills, but even when I’m away from <em>Newsnight</em> in the United States I end up keeping to the same schedule. I don’t think it’s exotic. It’s the same thing that everybody does: I get tired and go to sleep and get up, just later in the day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You do not say: 'I’m sorry. I cannot do this interview at 10.30am. I will be asleep.' Nobody takes that as an excuse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Is there something about the solitude and quiet that fits with writing?</strong><br />Yes. When I’ve got a book on the boil, and especially when my husband’s out of the country, which he often is, and in the winter when the sun goes down at three o’clock, I have a segment of time until 10pm when I can get work done. There is something about the lighting, with the desk lamp on, and it’s dark outside; it creates a little cocoon that’s very warm and protective and quiet and focused. And I do like that.</p> <p><strong>And what about after your writing stint?</strong><br />After I’m finished working, I always do my exercise, and then I’ll eat something, usually after midnight. The main problem with that routine is all these people who want to do things in the morning.</p> <p><strong>How do you deal with them?</strong><br />I try to fend them off to the best of my ability. But I can’t always. UK tradesmen in particular have a thing about showing up at 8am; they like to get their work done super-early and knock off at two in the afternoon. So we’re on completely different schedules. When there’s something that needs repairing, which is all the time, I get no sleep, fundamentally. I don’t find it possible to say oh, today I’m going to go to sleep at 9pm. It’s a real downside. I’m not recommending people adopt this schedule.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever just not answer the door, say to the postman?</strong><br />Well, the worst of both worlds is that I scramble into my robe, and hustle downstairs in what is to me the middle of the night, and I still miss the delivery. That’s standard. The rest of the temporally normal world don’t understand when you keep trying to schedule things in the afternoon. And I don’t want to get into it with them, so I sometimes I pretend that I have appointments in the morning. You do not say: “I’m sorry. I cannot do this interview at 10.30 in the morning. I will be asleep.” Nobody takes that as an excuse.</p> <p><strong>There is a kind of morality attached to being the early bird, isn’t there?</strong><br />The disapproval is unbelievable. And I get that even from delivery people. If I do hustle downstairs at 10.30 – and they probably got up at 5 – the contempt drips off them. I have to actually stop myself from saying: you don’t understand, I’m not some layabout. I actually have a job. I just keep different hours.</p> <p><strong>Your husband is a musician; does that make life easier?</strong><br />Yes. Jazz musicians work at night, they also stay up very late. He doesn’t make a habit of it, but it’s not extraordinary for my husband to get back at five, even six in the morning. At which point, he will find me in bed.</p> <p><strong>Being nocturnal does help when dramatic events unfold in the small hours, like Brexit, for example…</strong><br />I have to admit, I missed Brexit, and I rue that. I was so sure that Remain was going to win that I wasn’t filled with a sense of suspense, and I didn’t go out of my way to make sure I stayed in the UK to experience it. If I had known what I know now, I would have stuck around an extra week before coming to the US. As it happened, I did stay up here, until the result was in, and I was absolutely floored. We stayed up until Cameron’s resignation speech – it’s a little easier to stay up here because we’re five hours behind. Even so, I don’t think that night we got to sleep until 5am.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c66288125e54df7bcc26fc32ed5582438b6aab80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c66288125e54df7bcc26fc32ed5582438b6aab80/6_152_2470_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Shriver runs past Battle of Britain memorial in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Shriver, who prefers to exercise at night, runs past the Battle of Britain memorial in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Browne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You’re in the US at the moment – how’s that working with the current news cycle?</strong><br />The problem is that watching these conventions is unendurable. I hate political cant. It doesn’t even matter whether they’re good or bad performances. Bullshit is bullshit, right?</p> <p><strong>Are you in a novel-writing phase at the minute?</strong><br />Not right now. I’m working on a short story, but my productivity always goes down during the summer. I play a lot of tennis. And it’s hot.</p> <p><strong>You usually run at night, don’t you?</strong><br />Yes, although not in New York. And I play tennis during the day. One of the nice things, though, on the days that I’m not playing tennis, is exercising at night – nine, 10 o’clock. It’s much more bearable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon more people will be able to function with the schedule that suits them and I will become less weird</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What happens if someone asks you to lunch?</strong><br />Well, that’s a catastrophe. I have a rule against lunch, and I break that rule maybe once or twice a year, only for professional emergencies. Basically that’s a breakfast meeting. In fact, I had somebody propose a real breakfast meeting recently, and I was warned that it would be early. Obviously it would be like, 7am. I would have to stay up! I’d show up for the breakfast meeting expecting to have a cognac. It would do my reputation a world of good.</p> <p><strong>When we met at an event recently, you had just interviewed Damian Lewis, who was opening the Stock Exchange at 8am. Not the easiest commission for your body clock to handle…?</strong><br />Oh yes, I remember that. I was in training for days for that interview. But I was still way underslept for meeting someone who is not only famous, but also, it turns out, quite articulate and smart. I ended up being fortunate that he’s not only articulate and smart but rather garrulous, and I didn’t have to say very much.</p> <p><strong>Your latest novel, <em>The Mandibles</em>, is concerned with the future of economics, social structures and work patterns. Do you have a concept of what a 24-hour society might look like?</strong><br />I think we are certainly drifting towards many more people being self-employed, and who therefore make their own hours. And even people who are not self-employed are now being released to work at home at least a proportion of their week, and therefore have themselves to report to. There are whole corporations that have stopped making people clock in and don’t care any more how many hours you put in; all they care about is whether you get your work done. Which I think is great – it’s definitely a more intelligent organising principle. It means that people who naturally drift in the direction I do are going to be able to function with the schedule that suits them. So what we’re talking about will become more and more prevalent, and I will become less weird.</p> <p><strong>Would you actually like that, or is it more fun swimming against the tide?</strong><br />Right now I don’t care, but if the many other trends are anything to go by, whereby things that I’ve always done that were a little odd end up being adopted by the rest of the world, I’ll probably feel a bit resentful. Like, who are all these people? Go away. I’m supposed to be the only one who’s awake here.</p> <p><em>The Mandibles: A Family 2029-2047 is published by Borough Press, £16.99. </em><a

Empathy Problem by Gavin Extence – review","standfirst":"A dying hedge fund manager’s redemption is a promising idea, but the tale rings hollow","trailText":"A dying hedge fund manager’s redemption is a promising idea, but the tale rings hollow","byline":"Hannah Beckerman","body":"<p>When novelists decide to write a book about contemporary political or social events, they always engage in a narrative gamble: will the episodes they’re choosing to chronicle still feel timely and relevant come publication?</p> <p>Short of being in possession of a crystal ball, there was no way Gavin Extence could have known, as he sat down to write his third novel, <em>The Empathy Problem</em>, a story about a London hedge fund manager set against the backdrop of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\">2011/2012 Occupy movement,</a> that by the time the novel was published, the Occupy camp outside St Paul’s would feel historical rather than contemporary. There was no way he could have predicted that the banking crisis would have long since been replaced in the headlines by the Syrian refugee crisis, the EU referendum, Islamic State and almost weekly terror attacks across Europe. As such, the backdrop for a story Extence no doubt conceived of as a state-of-the-nation tale instead feels curiously anachronistic.</p> <p>Political backdrop aside, the idea for <em>The Empathy Problem</em> holds much promise. A 32-year-old hedge fund manager, Gabriel Vaughn, discovers he has a brain tumour and only six months to live. The diagnosis – or perhaps the tumour itself – begins to alter Gabriel’s behaviour profoundly , transforming him from a selfish, self-absorbed and self-aggrandising sociopath into someone who experiences – for the first time – feelings of empathy, love and slivers of social conscience.</p> <p>This is an enticing premise, with its elements of redemption. And much like Extence’s bestselling debut novel in 2013 – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/17/universe-alex-woods-extence-review\"><em>The Universe Versus Alex Woods</em></a>, which won the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterstones_11\">Waterstones 11</a> prize – it is the kind of plot that makes you want to enjoy the book before reading has begun.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <em>The Empathy Problem</em> never quite delivers on its emotional potential and the redemptive course of action Gabriel embarks upon feels underwhelming and hollow. Rather than, for instance, using the last six months of his life, and his extreme wealth, to some greater social good, Extence’s protagonist chooses to wreak financial revenge on his employers and colleagues, which even he admits at the end of the book won’t effect any lasting change: “They’ve taken a small hit to their personal fortunes, but they’re still multimillionaires. They get to walk away from this relatively unscathed. In that sense, I’m not sure anything I did made a huge difference.”</p> <p>He sells his flat to an oligarch, despite his suspicions that the purchase is purely for money-laundering purposes, and is unable to part company with his beloved yellow Ferrari. None of this creates the emotionally edifying story the book could have been. Gabriel does help the 11 secretaries at his firm escape their menial and unfulfilling jobs, but this feels like a small victory in a novel that had the potential to be a genuinely life-affirming narrative.</p> <p>The Occupy backdrop is also underutilised. It serves as a physical manifestation of Gabriel’s conscience – his office window overlooks the camp and the sight of it increasingly unsettles him – and it is the place where he meets the novel’s love interest, Caitlin. There is a scene in which Gabriel meets a number of protesters, leading to some rather heavy-handed political discussions and pointed character self-justifications, but beyond this, the two story strands never really coalesce.</p> <p>Although the central relationship in <em>The Empathy Problem</em> is between Gabriel and Caitlin, whose romantic trajectory follows a conventional path of love, loss and reconciliation, it is the encounters between Gabriel and his father that provide the most touching moments. Emotionally estranged since the death of Gabriel’s mother, there is a quiet tragedy to their inability to communicate.</p> <p>This is a novel that never quite gets under the skin of its story or its characters. Unlike the financial gambles that have made Gabriel a millionaire, Extence’s creative gamble never quite reaps the potential rewards.</p> <p><em> The Empathy Problem is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (£16.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/empathy-problem.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order it for £13.93

religion tend to have an axe to grind. Believers strain credulity to prove that gods exist, or at least their version of them. Meanwhile the violently anti-religious burn an equivalent amount of energy in seeking to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that such claims are plain bunkum – and damaging, cruel, sometimes murderous bunkum at that.</p> <p>Thank God, then – if I can use that phrase in a neutral way – for Richard Holloway and his carefully weighted, beautifully written and strangely compelling brief history of world religions. For he takes no sides but instead manages to be fair to all in his wise judgments, while instinctively understanding both the appeal of faith and its pitfalls.</p> <p>As well he might, for Holloway is famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/19/richard-holloway-leaving-alexandria-review\">a bishop who stopped believing in God</a>. A former head of the Anglican (Episcopal) Church in Scotland, he has spoken since his resignation in 2000 of a lifelong struggle to believe. Today a popular broadcaster and prolific writer, he is an agnostic, but bears no grudge against the religious calling that took up so much of his adult life.</p> <p>What threads the book together as it travels around the globe and through millennia, charting the growth and (sometimes) the decline of religions, is Holloway’s parallel search for what it is in the human situation and psyche that has made us hanker after religion in the first place. He puts it down to us still wanting to know where we come from as a species, what our place is in the universe, and most of all a fear of being alone. In the simplest of terms, religion feeds our appetite for hope – whether it be building communities around shared rituals and beliefs, creating an ultimate dispenser of justice, or just imagining life after life.</p> <p>Holloway tells his story in more or less chronological order from 130,000BC – the era when evidence of religious belief in the way our ancestors buried their dead first emerged – right through to today’s Scientologists, secular humanists and scary fundamentalists. Most writers who attempt such a sweep end up giving the religions they know best – by upbringing, culture or preference – too great a prominence. Not Holloway, though: he shows no favouritism to the various branches of the Christian family and is just as authoritative on Islam as he is on Anglicanism.</p> <p>And as clear-sighted. In the current, polarised climate in the Middle East, it is often deemed politic to avoid pointing out how derivative much of Muhammad’s message was when he started to preach it in 613, or indeed the large debt that Islam owes to Judaism. Holloway, though, has no time for such fudging. “There was,” he states plainly, “nothing original about his message and Muhammad never claimed there was. It was a reminder [to his hearers, the first Muslims] of what they had forgotten. It was the message of the prophet Abraham; idols were dupes and there was no God but God.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Methodists and Baptists might feel slighted at being entirely overlooked when Quakers get a whole chapter to themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is just as blunt about anyone who claims to have a brand new insight into the divine mind and sets up his own religion (and they are almost entirely men). “Religions are a dime a dozen,” he writes, as ever giving the overview, even in the midst of an avalanche of detail. “And there’s always room for another in the spiritual marketplace. The game changes when the new creed starts threatening the profits and privileges of the established set-up.” That, he points out, is what happened with Jesus in first-century Jerusalem, just as surely as it did with Muhammad in seventh-century Mecca.</p> <p>Which brings us neatly to the question of religious violence. It is a commonplace in the west today that religion is the cause of all the violence in the world. Some experts, though, have argued persuasively against this view, among them the eminent religious historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/karenarmstrong\">Karen Armstrong</a> – another person formerly of faith (she was a Catholic nun) who now stands back and takes a dispassionate view. Violence purportedly carried out in the name of God, she holds, is nearly always in reality caused by other factors – political, social, racial and economic.</p> <p>Holloway half accepts Armstrong’s point, but is less inclined to absolve religion itself. It has still caused, he insists, some of the worst violence in history. “So if we mean by God the loving creator of the universe,” he writes, “then either he doesn’t exist or religion has got him wrong.”</p> <p>There are, inevitably, drawbacks in trying to cram 130,000 years of history, and the theology that underpins it, into fewer than 260 pages. Methodists and Baptists, for example, might feel slighted at being entirely overlooked when Quakers, much smaller in number, get a whole chapter to themselves.</p> <p>Equally, compressing the essence of elaborate systems of belief, which have evolved over thousands of years, into pithy and transparent sentences can cause corners to be cut. Next year sees the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther “starting” the Reformation by nailing his 95 theses to the door of a church in Wittenberg, in Germany. Most historians now accept that he never brandished his hammer, but Holloway includes the detail anyway, with no disclaimer. Religions, after all, like their myths and legends.</p> <p>But these are venial rather than mortal sins. If the book has a message for our times, it comes when Holloway notes the fact that religion has an extraordinary instinct for survival. It is, he writes, “the anvil that has worn out many hammers”.</p> <p>Since, on such a basis, it is here to stay for the foreseeable future, there can be no better place to learn more about it than in the pages of this enlightening book.</p> <p><em>A Little History of Religion is published by Yale University Press (£14.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-history-of-religion.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order it for £12.29 </em></a></p>","wordcount":"971","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-04T08:15:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4ptep","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5efaa759fc9737004537c7fa8a58c16c812030ed/0_155_4256_2554/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/peter-stanford","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Peter Stanford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peter-stanford","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/peter-stanford","references":[],"bio":"<p>Peter Stanford is a former editor of the Catholic Herald and author of Religion: 50 Ideas You Really Need to Know and Heaven: A Traveller's Guide</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/7/2/1278081196132/peter-stanford.jpg","firstName":"peter","lastName":"stanford"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webTitle":"The Observer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[],"description":"From the Observer, the Sunday newspaper and sister publication of the Guardian."},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"The New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/new-review/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/new-review/books","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"5efaa759fc9737004537c7fa8a58c16c812030ed","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5efaa759fc9737004537c7fa8a58c16c812030ed/0_155_4256_2554/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"mecca lit up at night seen from jabal al nour","caption":"Light of religion: a pilgrim looks down on Mecca from Jabal al-Nour during the annual hajj.

The desire for independence and self-reliance is one Kelman has addressed consistently; in the past, he has identified himself as one who spoke from within an occupied country. He has also stated his desire to write and remain a member of his own community. <em>Dirt Road</em> may well be his most optimistic dramatisation to date of the possibilities of political and personal enfranchisement.</p> <p>It opens with 16-year-old Murdo and his father, Tom, leaving Scotland to visit family in Alabama, following the deaths of Murdo’s mother and sister from cancer. The trip is clearly a huge undertaking for Tom, whose anxiety reveals itself in his concern that they will not manage to contact Murdo’s uncle, his fear they will miss buses, and in his chastisement of Murdo for forgetting his phone, assuming their relatives will provide towels, popping out to the shop… even for looking inside sandwiches. We do not know whether Tom has always been so critical, or if it is a result of his recent bereavement, but it makes for saddening reading; Murdo is a well-intentioned, warm-hearted young man, dealing with his own burden of grief and apparently not getting much support.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Listening is what Murdo does effortlessly, highly attuned, as he is, to sound and music. He believes music can free you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kelman shows rather than tells par excellence, narrating the entire novel through Murdo’s consciousness, replete with dialect such as “didnay” and “jeesoh”. The reader is privy to everything, from Murdo’s concern not to spread zits when shaving to his sexual fantasies and meditations, sometimes quite profound, on the nature of consciousness.</p> <p>Murdo is innocent, old fashioned and shy; the hour or so he spends with a girl he meets early on in his visit to America is enough to tempt him to journey across the country to join her at a Cajun music festival, in defiance of his father. His decision is brave, desperate, reckless and understandable, given the extremely short leash Tom has kept him on, and given Murdo’s overriding passion for music – he feels physically weak when he has not played for a while, and often laments the fact that his father did not allow him to bring his accordion. His journey to the Lafayette festival, a possibly doomed undertaking, signals the beginning of a healthier relationship with Tom and serves as a metaphor for Murdo’s emerging selfhood. We cannot imagine he would have dreamed of running away prior to this holiday, but within the briefest of time spans Kelman allows us to see Murdo become a new version of himself.</p> <p>Kelman’s prose requires proper listening. Listening is what Murdo does effortlessly, highly attuned, as he is, to sound and music. He believes music can free you; take you anywhere at all. While Murdo acts out his desire for self-fulfilment, Tom lives in as constrained a way as possible. It is fortunate, then, that his son’s rebellion forces him to take action and bring the more generous aspects of his underlying love to the fore. Tom forgives Murdo for running away, enjoys himself at the music festival, gets up to dance and even, after some persuading, allows Murdo to remain on tour with his new friends, something he would have been unlikely to concede to at the outset.

Few albums have captured the feeling of leaving the club at an ungodly hour, coming down off something and having to catch the night-bus home to somewhere in deepest south London as this feted outing from Burial, who imagined a drowning city. There’s even a track on it called Night Bus.</p> <h2>Kate Kellaway’s top five night fiction</h2> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-morning-midnight.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Good Morning, Midnight</strong></a><br /><strong>Jean Rhys (1939)</strong><br />This captivating, memorable novel about loneliness takes its title from American poet Emily Dickinson’s lines: “Good morning, Midnight!

lived in Moscow, I more often than not walked to work down Okhotny Ryad, a grand central boulevard. Like many places in Russia, it had been renamed after 1991 as part of a push to remove anything redolent of communism from the map. Like many de-Sovietising initiatives, however, the process was abandoned halfway through. Karl Marx Avenue might have become Okhotny Ryad, but a statue of the man who inspired the Soviet regime stayed in situ, a few yards away from the traffic, where the road meets Theatre Square.</p> <p>The statue’s plinth proclaims: “Workers of the world, unite!” The statue itself shows him with flowing locks swept back from his forehead as if by a stiff breeze, above a full beard, all hewn ruggedly out of granite. This statue formed an occasional focal point for slightly forlorn demonstrations by some of Russia’s remaining communists, who waved their red flags and demanded that Vladimir Putin resign.</p> <p>I sometimes thought, when looking at their demonstrations as I walked by, that de-Sovietisers could still solve the problem if they wanted, by just affixing a different slogan over the communist one and pretending the statue didn’t represent Marx at all. With his bushy beard and beetling brow, the great communist could easily be a mystic from the early days of Orthodox Christianity (though, admittedly, the greatcoat and tie would be hard to explain). That’s the thing about Marx – he looks right; he looks like you’d expect a prophet to look. Before you even hear the details of his arguments, you find yourself thinking: someone with that much hair has to have a point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/top-10-philosophers-fictions\">Top 10 philosophers' fictions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The magnificence of Marx’s mane has clearly long been a major part of his personal brand. It graces his grave in Highgate cemetery and here it is again, adorning the cover of Gareth Stedman Jones’s exhaustive and staggeringly well-researched intellectual biography. Stedman Jones is professor of the history of ideas at Queen Mary, University of London, and has long focused on Marx. This book is an attempt to separate the man (whom he calls “Karl” throughout, thus distinguishing him from the mythical “Marx”) from the Marxist movement he inspired.</p> <p>Karl Marx was born in 1818 in Trier, a town in the Rhineland-Palatinate (a western province of what is now Germany), which had recently been added to the Kingdom of Prussia, having been held by France since shortly after the French revolution. The Napoleonic wars had only just finished and Europe was entering into a turbulent period, full of industrial innovation, revolutionary activities, philosophical debates and more. Growing up, Marx was a precocious student who befriended many of the leading German-speaking philosophers of the time. By his late 20s, he was describing himself as a communist and engaging in heated debates with fellow travellers who raised points he disagreed with, often so forcefully that they barely recovered from the experience.</p> <p>The revolutionary upheavals of 1848 carried him across western Europe – France, Belgium, Germany – until eventually he ended up in London, where he attempted to write up his unifying theory of humanity’s progress towards a socialist utopia that still inspires those protesters around his statue in Moscow. He had already met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/09/engels-condition-of-working-class\" title=\"\">Friedrich Engels</a> (who also frequently appears as a Russian statue, despite being less hirsute), who became both his closest intellectual collaborator and the source of much of the money he lived on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn’t help noticing some clear parallels between modern leftist politics and the habits of the old man</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Marx had a restless intellect and he constantly sought to fit the world into his worldview. It was an effort so enormous it quite destroyed his health. By the end of his life, he was largely avoiding talking about work to his well-wishers, since they would only ask when he would produce more of it.</p> <p>Stedman Jones argues that much of what we now think of as Marxism – and, thus, much of what went on to inspire socialist and communist parties – was the creation of Engels, who codified Marx’s theories after his death, thus making them palatable for people unable or unwilling to wade through his dense texts. It was Engels, for example, who insisted on drawing parallels between Marx and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/charles-darwin\" title=\"\">Charles Darwin</a>, when Marx himself was far from convinced of the importance of the theory of natural selection. Stedman Jones develops his argument very gradually, with regular stops to survey the intellectual milieu in which Marx was working. Many of the characters are obscure, so parts of the book are perhaps best suited to people who already know a significant amount about the history of 19th-century philosophy.</p> <p>Stedman Jones eventually comes to the conclusion that the pioneers of 20th-century socialism would have found Marx’s true dreams incomprehensible, since they were formed in a pre-1848 world that would have had little if any relevance to them. The eventual message is that Marxist ideology and Marx himself were very different things.</p> <p>I couldn’t help noticing while reading the book, however, some clear parallels between modern leftist politics and the habits of the old man. Thanks to his obsession with minute points of ideological deviation, his determination to cling to leadership positions despite the increasing irrelevance of the groups he led, his conviction that victory was imminent despite near-overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and his repeated estrangement of potential allies for no apparent reason, Marx would surely have felt at home in today’s Labour party.</p> <p><em>Karl Marx: Greatness and Illusion</em> is published by Allen Lane (£35). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/karl-marx-greatness-and-illusion.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Click here to buy it for £28.70</a></p> <p><em> </em></p>","wordcount":"918","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-04T07:15:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pted","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c5cfe5a3da071974462dac95cbb6f255f69fb9/0_442_3928_2355/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/biography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Biography","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/biography","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/biography","references":[]},{"id":"books/karl-marx","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Karl Marx","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-marx","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/karl-marx","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"books/politics","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/politics","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/oliverbullough","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Oliver Bullough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliverbullough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/oliverbullough","references":[],"bio":"<p>Oliver Bullough is the author of two non-fiction books about Russian history and politics: The Last Man in Russia, and Let Our Fame Be Great.

Explains How Human Behaviour</em> <em>Changes Online</em>; and the potted bio, informing us that “Dr Mary Aiken is the world’s foremost forensic cyberpsychologist” – all clues indicating that this is a book targeted at the US market, another addition to that sprawling genre of books by folks with professional qualifications using pop science to frighten the hoi polloi.</p> <p>This is a pity, because <em>The Cyber Effect</em> is really rather good and doesn’t need its prevailing tone of relentless self-promotion to achieve its desired effect, which is to make one think about what digital technology is doing to us. At this stage, there can’t be many people who haven’t, at one time or another, fretted about this question. After all, the technology has invaded every aspect of our lives; it is changing social and private behaviour, having a disproportionate impact on our children and facilitating types of criminal and antisocial behaviour that are repulsive and sometimes terrifying. And it is now also changing democratic politics: the most interesting thing about Donald Trump is how his narcissistic personality has found its perfect expression in Twitter – which is how we come to have <a href=\"http://www.maryaiken.com/news/2016/6/17/welcome-to-the-troll-election\" title=\"\">an internet troll running for president</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aiken finds it alarming that parents of babies believe that it’s good for infants to have access to technology</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But at the same time our public discourse about technology remains depressingly Manichaean – with enthusiasts (and a formidably powerful global industry) extolling its wonders, while critics focus only on its manifest downsides. But this isn’t a proper debate: we are like two drunks in a bar arguing about whether oxygen is, on balance, a good or a bad thing.</p> <p>The reality is that digital technology (like most technologies) is <em>both</em> good and bad. And, as with oxygen, it’s not going to go away. So the only rational way forward is to figure out how to live intelligently with it. But in order to do that we need to understand it. The industry and its boosters have done a pretty good job in explaining the advantages. What we lack is an informed understanding of the problems, dangers and pathologies to which it gives rise.</p> <p>This is the gap that Dr Aiken seeks to fill. As a psychologist, her prime interest is in the scientific understanding of online behaviour. “If I seem to focus on many of the negative aspects of technology,” she writes, “it is in order to bring the debate back to the balanced centre rather than have one driven by utopian idealism or commercialism. My job is just to provide the best wisdom possible, based on what we know about human beings and how their cognitive, behavioural, physiological, social, developmental, affective, and motivational capabilities have been exploited or compromised or changed by the design of these products.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/04/why-spending-more-time-on-the-internet-is-a-good-thing\">Why spending more time on the internet is a good thing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her book has to cover a lot of ground. She begins with fetishes and addiction and leaves one in little doubt that the old boast of the now defunct <em>News of the World</em> (“All human life is here”) is definitely fulfilled by the internet. Aiken’s point is really just that the network provides unprecedented opportunities for personalities that are warped in particular ways to follow their inclinations, harmless or otherwise.</p> <p>But in a way, we knew much of this. Where Aiken really hits her stride is in three central chapters covering the impact of digital technology on children and young people. Here she makes a powerful case for the view that our society has been criminally negligent in the way it puts children in the harm’s way of digital technology. This is partly about the usual dangers of pornography, paedophilia, cyberbullying etc, but it’s just as much about the casual laxity of parents, and the way in which the technology industry continues to avoid responsibility for the perils that it facilitates and the damage that its products can do.</p> <p>For example, Aiken finds it alarming (as I do) that parents of babies mistakenly believe that it’s good for infants to have access to the technology from very young ages. As I write, I’m looking at the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Ipad-Apptivity-Seat-Newborn-to-Toddler/dp/B00EL4NI5U\" title=\"\">Fisher-Price iPad Apptivity Seat</a>, which Amazon.com is selling for $57.99.

Yet it turns out that between 23% and 34% of kids under that age have Facebook accounts. When asked why the company doesn’t enforce its own rules, a spokesman shrugged. “We haven’t got a mechanism for eradicating the problem,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/23/facebook-admits-powerless-young-users\" title=\"\">he said</a>. For a company with the technological resources of Facebook, this is simply not a credible response. The real reason must be that keeping underage users out is not a corporate priority.</p> <p>Other areas covered by Aiken are online dating, cyberchondria and cybercrime, but the real strength of this book is the persuasive case it makes for taking seriously the potential damage to children. This is partly – but only partly – a matter of regulation, which in relation to the internet is always a tricky problem. But it’s mainly a problem of the cognitive dissonance which afflicts us all in relation to digital technology. Most of us love it and value the ways it enhances our lives and augments our capabilities. (What is the web, after all, but a memory prosthesis for humanity?) But, deep down, as we see what digital technology is doing to behaviour, relationships, crime and politics, we’re also aware that it’s becoming increasingly dangerous and problematic – and that it’s our grandchildren who will really reap this whirlwind. If nothing else, <em>The Cyber Effect</em> should enable us to have a more sophisticated conversation about it.</p> <p><em>The Cyber Effect is published by John Murray (£20). </em><a

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture. I wrote them all; I told their stories.</p> <p>And then I started to write a book. I created a British copper who’d lost it all, his wife, his kid, his house, his job, and his soul.</p> <p>The Darkest Hour<em> is out now (William Morrow, £7.99).

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","byline":"Ben Myers","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/455m8"},"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jamesbaldwin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Baldwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamesbaldwin","references":[]},{"id":"books/franzkafka","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Franz Kafka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/franzkafka","references":[]},{"id":"books/fyodordostoevsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benmyers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Myers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benmyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benmyers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Myers is an author and journalist.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","byline":"Michelle Dean","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","wordcount":"3166","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/45xtn"},"tags":[{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"world/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/religion","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/ohio","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webTitle":"Ohio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/ohio","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"World news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/michelle-dean","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Michelle Dean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michelle-dean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/michelle-dean","references":[],"bio":"<p>Michelle Dean is a critic and journalist based in New York</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Columnist/Head_shots/2014/11/19/1416432311450/Michelle-Dean-003.jpg","firstName":"michelle","lastName":"dean"}],"elements":[{"id":"cb6b20b56055d09e0be1ccc10c273e0536d24694","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608386967/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"altText":"Malarkey family","caption":"In a photo from January 2009, Beth Malarkey covers up her son, Alex, after surgery as Alex’s father, Kevin, watches.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it? Marvelous! *in bridget jones&#39; voice.* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyweate\">@jeremyweate</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/XKz2ReQAqT\">pic.twitter.com/XKz2ReQAqT</a></p>&mdash; Ainehi Edoro  (@brittlepaper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/status/546265681302286336\">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missaminathula\">Amina Thula</a>’s Cape Town romance Elevator Kiss, the leading couple break all the rules when, as perfect strangers, they kiss on their first encounter. This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

Castle","byline":"Maev Kennedy","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"439","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44pzh"},"tags":[{"id":"culture/heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[],"bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142224016/Maev-Kennedy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142245982/Maev-Kennedy-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kennedy"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","wordcount":"1024","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44ev3"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum selects the definitive 100 novels written in English"},{"id":"books/malcolm-lowry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Malcolm Lowry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malcolm-lowry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/malcolm-lowry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Murder, intrigue and a beguiling protagonist make <strong>Adam LeBor</strong>’s international thriller <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062330017/the-washington-stratagem\"><strong>The Washington Stratagem</strong></a> a gripping and enticing read.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Edpilkington\">@Edpilkington</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I’m both addicted to and critical of mystery novels. You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign. From the first sentence, Gay presents the reader with the one of the most visceral and haunting depictions of trauma on the female body and spirit.</p> <p><em><strong>Sarah Galo, open intern (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahEvonne\">@SarahEvonne</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/shining-girls-lauren-beukes-review\"><strong>Lauren Beukes’s The Shining Girls</strong></a> taught me how to love the suspense novel with its precise and powerful tale of a time-traveling serial killer and the rough, young female out to stop him. Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country. Accessible without conceding authority, hugely detailed without surrendering clarity or literary flair. A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

again","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut Chris Hadfield’s You Are Here to Japanese novel The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, with just one memoir, neurosurgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm, in the lineup.</p> <p>At Waterstones, the Private Eye Annual was the chain’s Christmas No 1, followed by Martin’s autobiography, Jessie Burton’s debut novel, The Miniaturist, and Girl Online.</p> <h2><strong>Nielsen book chart for Christmas week

When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains. Open any of her books and there she is: the unbeatable, unmistakeable, irreplaceable, unforgettable Sue.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-24T09:00:10Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4488n"},"tags":[{"id":"books/sue-townsend","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Sue Townsend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sue-townsend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/sue-townsend","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","type":"series","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webTitle":"Obituaries of 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","references":[],"description":"The Observer's look back at some of those who died in 2014, remembered by those who knew them best"},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"culture/adrian-mole","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Adrian Mole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/adrian-mole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/adrian-mole","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/niccigerrard","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Nicci Gerrard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/niccigerrard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/niccigerrard","references":[],"bio":"<p>Nicci Gerrard is a novelist and author of Soham: A Story Of Our Times.

gap between what was said and what was done","byline":"Richard Coles","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","wordcount":"514","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448tj"},"tags":[{"id":"books/pdjames","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"PD
