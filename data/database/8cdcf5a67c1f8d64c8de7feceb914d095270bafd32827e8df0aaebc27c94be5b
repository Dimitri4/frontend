President Vladimir Putin (L) meets with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Konstantinovsky Palace outside Saint Petersburg on August 9, 2016. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin on August 9, 2016 hosted Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in their first encounter since Ankara downed one of Moscow's warplanes last November, sparking a deep diplomatic crisis. The shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by a Turkish F-16 over the Syrian border last November saw a furious Putin slap economic sanctions on Turkey and launch a blistering war of words with Erdogan that seemed to irrevocably damage burgeoning ties. / AFP PHOTO / ALEXANDER NEMENOVALEXANDER NEMENOV/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Alexander Nemenov","source":"AFP/Getty Images","width":"4396","height":"2638","secureFile":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fe119366d0cf1c771c9bf12a6125e074642037f/0_38_4396_2638/4396.jpg","displayCredit":"true","mediaId":"6fe119366d0cf1c771c9bf12a6125e074642037f","imageType":"Photograph","suppliersReference":"AFP_E69FL","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/6fe119366d0cf1c771c9bf12a6125e074642037f","copyright":"AFP or licensors"}},{"type":"image","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fe119366d0cf1c771c9bf12a6125e074642037f/0_38_4396_2638/500.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Konstantinovsky Palace outside Saint Petersburg on August 9, 2016. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin on August 9, 2016 hosted Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in their first encounter since Ankara downed one of Moscow's warplanes last November, sparking a deep diplomatic crisis.
