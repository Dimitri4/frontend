Practically overnight, Westminster’s most vivid characters – from the Notting Hill set to Nigel Farage – vanished. One of the few recognisable names still left on Labour’s front bench is Tom Watson, whose charismatic reputation and geeky glamour should therefore elevate him to celebrity status in this colourless new political landscape. But ever since the early hours of 24 June, Labour’s deputy leader has retreated behind a blank facial glaze so opaque as to render him completely inscrutable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/trotskyists-young-labour-members-jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson\">Trotskyists 'twisting arms' of young Labour members to back Corbyn, Watson says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When appearing beside Jeremy Corbyn, he wears an expression normally reserved for funerals, which of course only makes me all the more curious to know what he is thinking. I ask about his thoughts while he watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-first-pmq-prime-minister-questions-panel\">Theresa May demolish Corbyn at her first prime minister’s questions</a>, and he starts to chuckle.</p> <p>“Well, at PMQs I always try to get myself into a Buddha-like state. I try not to have any facial expression at all. Because if I laugh at a Jeremy joke, two hours later on social media it’s either interpreted as me laughing at Jeremy, or laughing at an opposition joke. Or, if I scowl at something someone says, people are accusing me of scowling at Jeremy. So I try to keep a straight face, which everyone always interprets as me looking really sad and miserable. That’s actually not the case. I’m generally just trying to remain expressionless.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8aacea706bdd011e0b1c1790d37de4b1b6a62f/0_29_1746_1047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson does a good job at keeping it up for most of this interview, too. When we speak before the high court ruling on Labour’s leadership contest, the detached serenity he affects is disconcertingly implausible. But, as he points out several times, he will have to serve as deputy to whichever leader his party elects. “I’m 50 next year, so I’ve learned not to worry about the things you’ve got no control of. I’ve not really been in control of events in the last few weeks, and if I can’t control events, I can’t worry about them.”</p> <p>He certainly did not predict them. Watson had no idea that Labour’s leader would call for article 50 to be triggered at once, within hours of the referendum result. “But if I’m being honest, I’d not focused a lot on the plan B in the planning meetings that I’d had with him.”</p> <p>Failing to anticipate the impact Corbyn’s words would have on Labour MPs – “At that point I was so exhausted, I didn’t take it in on the Friday” – he made his way to Glastonbury.</p> <p>Watson was offline <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/labour-enforcer-tom-watson-filmed-8284779\">in a silent disco</a> when Corbyn sacked Hilary Benn late that Saturday night, and remained blissfully unaware of the unfolding crisis until he awoke the next morning to a “whole load of missed calls and texts”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1/0_102_625_870/359.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Watson/Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Laura_K_Hughes/status/746992729100541952?ref_src=twsrc^tfw\">spent the day on the phone</a>, hurrying back to London, “trying to find out what was happening”. Remarkably, he didn’t speak to Corbyn. Did he even try? “I can’t remember, actually,” he offers vaguely. I’m not sure which would be more bizarre: Corbyn refusing to take his deputy’s call, or Watson not even bothering to phone. When they met the next day, “As ever with Jeremy, it was business-like and friendly.” Watson told him the resignations could have been prevented, had Corbyn only reached out to his shadow team and addressed their concerns. Corbyn disagreed, convinced it was a premeditated coup. “He didn’t seem angry. Just puzzled and sorrowful.”</p> <p>When Watson heard that a no-confidence motion had been tabled, “I didn’t pay it much heed. I thought it wouldn’t have legs.” He won’t say which way he voted, but the result came as a shock. Even then, it didn’t occur to him that Corbyn would defy the PLP’s indictment. “I thought he would realise that to lose the confidence of 80% of your MPs means that you can’t lead the Labour party.” Watson tried to say so in private two days later, but was thwarted when two Corbyn aides made an unscheduled appearance in their car.</p> <p>“I was told we would have the journey on our own, and they came. I did suggest that they didn’t, and they said we’re coming in the car. So it became very difficult to have the conversation.” Was he angry? Watson looks conflicted. “You know, at any point in time I want to put my arms around him and hug him and say it’s going to be all right, but also sort of shout and say, we need to talk about this. So I was actually feeling great sorrow for him.”</p> <p>It wasn’t until six days after the no-confidence vote that Watson met Corbyn privately. “It was very sad, really. But it was also, as ever, polite. I said, I don’t think you can lead the Labour party if you’ve lost 80% of your MPs, and he said, well, look, you’ve said what you have to say, and thank you for saying it. I think he actually said, thank you for saying it in such a polite way. It was still friendly. I did my duty. I did what I could. What else can you do?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7dfe82e112bfe7bf46362122585fdb7ed0c8c9/0_138_4864_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson and Corbyn visit a Sikh temple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He answers his own question minutes later, after protestations of reluctance that may or not be genuine. His plans “are at a nascent stage”, he says several times, “and I probably shouldn’t even begin to talk to Decca Aitkenhead of the Guardian about them”. But he does.</p> <p>Watson wants to reverse Ed Miliband’s “terrible error of judgment” and reinstate the old electoral college system, which accorded one-third of the votes in a leadership election to the PLP and a third each to the unions and the members. He is also drawing up proposals for an agreement “to have women holding some of the key offices of state. My personal view is if you don’t give a proper gender representation on the frontbench you’re in trouble, and either Owen or Jeremy will have to make sure that those big offices have women in them.”</p> <p>Most significantly, Watson wants to reintroduce elections to the shadow cabinet. Is he sure that MPs who resigned, or refused to serve under Corbyn, would reconsider if elected by the PLP? “I have no idea. But I think if Owen wins it’s still important to do it, because a new leader has got to reshape and rebuild the PLP, and that means giving respect and dignity back to a lot of colleagues.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c968a6d4f88582edd2e30b5f3785c2061a71c3db/0_290_5672_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson at the Labour party conference in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How much time he will have to effect any of this is uncertain, if Watson is right about his next point. “I think it’s highly likely there’ll be an early election. I mean, if you’re Theresa May, with a majority of 12, with your Brexit fanatics already saying you’re not going quickly enough to get us out of the European Union, with having sacked too many people from the frontbench who are just looking for the opportunity for her to stumble, and with a double-digit lead in the polls, then even though on day one you might not think you’re going to have an early election, I think it’s almost inevitable you’ll get to a point where you have to. If you were Theresa May, why wouldn’t you? Honestly, why wouldn’t you? You’d get your own mandate, you’d have the easiest run at the election you could imagine, and in all likelihood you’d come back with a bigger majority. Why wouldn’t you do that?”</p> <p>Could whoever wins the leadership election survive a defeat in a general election? “Well, I don’t know. I don’t know. I mean, it’s highly unlikely, isn’t it? Most leaders resign after losing an election.” Most leaders, I point out, resign after losing the confidence of 80% of MPs. “Well, yes. So it’s still possible, isn’t it?”</p> <p>Watson is conspicuously reluctant to apportion blame for the crisis facing Labour, but when pressed, he acknowledges, “There are Trots that have come back to the party, and they certainly don’t have the best interests of the Labour party at heart. They see the Labour party as a vehicle for revolutionary socialism, and they’re not remotely interested in winning elections, and that’s a problem. But I don’t think the vast majority of people that have joined the Labour party and have been mobilised by the people that are in Momentum are all Trots and Bolsheviks. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f73a2a0fc07a6ab0e9841cbf6061cffb0e9505/0_25_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson gives the closing speech at the autumn conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Some months ago, I described Momentum as ‘a bit of a rabble’, and although leading lights in Momentum privately acknowledged to me that they were a bit of a rabble, it caused great offence to everyone that had signed up to Momentum. Some of these people are deeply interested in political change, in building a more equal society, and are just on a journey in politics that they’re new to, and I don’t want them to feel that I’m labelling them because I’m not. But there are some old hands twisting young arms in this process, and I’m under no illusions about what’s going on. They are caucusing and factionalising and putting pressure where they can, and that’s how Trotsky entryists operate. Sooner or later, that always end up in disaster. It always ends up destroying the institutions that are vulnerable, unless you deal with it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/tom-watson-the-canny-peacemaker-combatting-conspiracy-theorists\">Tom Watson: the canny peacemaker combatting conspiracy theorists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What can Watson say to Guardian readers angry with him for betraying the mandate party members invested in him to serve as a loyal deputy to the leader they elected? By asking Corbyn to stand down, didn’t Watson serve the will of self-important MPs instead?</p> <p>“I don’t think many Guardian readers would think that. I hope most Guardian readers would have a modicum of sympathy for the situation I find myself in. I don’t want us to be here. I don’t want us to be in this position. I didn’t want Hilary to be sacked. I didn’t want there to be a whole set of resignations. I didn’t want us to be 16 points behind in the polls. I didn’t want any of this. I’m not in control of events, but I’m doing what I can.”</p> <p>He is adamant that the party will not split in the event of Corbyn’s re-election. “I don’t know of any MPs who think the party should split, and frankly I think the claim that there’s a plan out there to split the party is propaganda which actually undermines a lot of people in the PLP. Every single person I talk to on the left and right of the party thinks this is a bad idea. I’ve not had anyone muse with me about it. I’ve not had anyone gossip with me about it. I’ve not heard anyone raising it as an issue.”</p> <p>Watson remains in contact with Corbyn, though it sounds rather semi-detached. “We still send the odd text to each other. It’s usually about family stuff, you know. My dad’s ill, and he’s always asking about my dad. My dad’s a big supporter of Jeremy. It’s a sort of chat really.”</p> <p>Such is Watson’s reputation as master of dark arts, some observers have speculated that behind the careful facade of neutrality he is issuing coded messages via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson\">his Twitter feed</a>. In recent weeks, it has become increasingly eccentric, featuring links to months’ old articles, such as one headlined: “Why Bad Ideas Refuse to Die.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_watson/status/762775167445692418\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It&#39;s world cat day.

I’m certainly not trying to send a secret signal through the medium of Twitter.”</p> <p>Does he still feel, I ask, like Labour’s arch-fixer?</p> <p>“Well, I’ve not done very well at it,” he laughs. “I know I’ve got a reputation for being a fixer. I know it’s my label. But the truth is, I’ve never been a very good fixer. And I couldn’t fix this.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"6","wordcount":"2073","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T11:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T15:08:38Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T11:30:44Z","internalComposerCode":"57a8a076e4b0f5d064841819","internalOctopusCode":"11790953","internalPageCode":"2639891","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T23:26:20Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

He said: “The overwhelming majority of new members joined the Labour party because they want to build a fairer and more equal society. But there is clear and incontrovertible evidence that a small group of Trotskyite activists have taken leading roles in the Labour party or are seeking to do so.</p> <p>“They are also explicitly targeting Young Labour and Labour student clubs with the aim of recruiting new members. That is beyond dispute. We can’t deal with this problem until we acknowledge it exists.”</p> <p>Last week, Peter Taaffe, the Socialist party’s leader, and founder member of Militant, told the <em>Guardian</em> that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">hoped to be readmitted to Labour</a>.</p> <p>Corbyn said: “I want people to join for good motives. But if they have changed their political views or developed their political views, then surely that is a good thing. We can only win a general election by winning people over from either non-voting or voting for another party. If someone has developed their politics to be members of the Labour party, even though they were once members of the Lib Dems, or Greens or something, fine. Welcome aboard.”</p> <p>Asked about Taaffe’s comments, he added: “I met Peter Taaffe many, many years ago. I have no idea if he has even applied to join. I have had no conversations with Peter. I look forward to a conversation with Peter at some point but, hey, let’s be happy for what we have got, this vast number of members we have got and let’s get on with campaigning.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\">interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In his extended interview, Corbyn:</p> <p>• Announced a cradle-to-grave free National Education Service under which there will be free universal childcare, the scrapping of tuition fees, the reintroduction of maintenance grants and renewed funding for adult education.</p> <p>• Offered backing for the RMT strikers on Southern Rail and Eurostar.</p> <p>• Predicted a reselection process for every Labour MP when constituency boundaries are redrawn in 2017, and committed to allowing local members to make their choice unimpeded.</p> <p>• Pledged an active state under his premiership willing to intervene widely in the market.</p> <p>The Labour leader condemned the booing at the two leadership hustings that have taken place.

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<h2><strong>Dear Jess</strong></h2> <p>My name is Emma and I am a national organiser for Momentum. Until last year, I was a primary school teacher in your constituency in Yardley, Birmingham. The children in my class were fantastic – full of potential, charisma and creativity. But, as you know, it is an area of high social deprivation and many of the children had challenging and insecure home lives. Statistically, despite their natural abilities, the kids in my class are less likely to achieve at school, less likely to find fulfilling work and less likely to live long and healthy lives. These are precisely the people who need a strong, united Labour party, capable of winning elections and transforming Britain.</p> <p>For too long, Labour hasn’t felt like a transformative party. For most people, all politicians are the same. For many, Labour might be the slightly nicer face of the establishment, but it’s still the establishment. It has failed to present a genuine alternative to the market-driven, austerity economics that sees inequality spiral and puts profit-making above people time after time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> was the first Labour leader in decades to stand on a bold platform for real, progressive change. And look what happened: a historic mandate, a tripling membership and an explosion of activity in Labour’s grassroots. The Labour party is once again a social movement and becoming a mass party rooted in communities. Momentum is part of this story.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.peoplesmomentum.com\" title=\"\">Momentum</a> was launched just weeks after Jeremy won, to build on the energy and enthusiasm from the campaign to increase participatory democracy, solidarity and grassroots power and help Labour become the transformative governing party of the 21st century.</p> <p>Momentum has more than 150,000 supporters, 15,000 paying members and more than 150 local groups. For the last 10 months, Momentum’s network has been finding new and exciting ways of engaging people in the political process and bringing thousands of new people into the Labour family and encouraging them to participate fully in the party.</p> <p>People who have previously felt excluded from party politics have been inspired to become active. Whether it is through Momentum football events, where political workshops take place before a football match, or the people’s politics, philosophy and economics lecture and workshop series, thousands of people have become more politically engaged through Momentum.</p> <p>This moment is an opportunity for the Labour party. Across the UK, constituency Labour parties have seen their turnouts mushroom. Engaging more people in the party has allowed us to act as a stronger opposition to the Tory government and be more efficient in winning elections, with successes in the 2016 mayoral elections and byelections. Through this wider and more organised network we have started to persuade people that Jeremy’s politics are an effective alternative to the status quo, reflected in the 128,000 people who joined the party in the fortnight after Brexit. There are a lot of people who need us to win, Jess, and to win with a programme that can truly transform Britain.</p> <p>Labour members will decide over the five weeks who they want to lead the party. Whoever wins, I look forward to working with you to build a more democratic, equal and decent society.<br /><em>Emma</em><br /></p> <h2><strong>Dear Emma</strong></h2> <p>I remember that you were a teacher in my constituency. You told me when we met months ago. In case you’ve forgotten, we were in parliament. I missed my train home to meet you. I chatted with you about your movement, offered to join in, asked if you wanted to come to Yardley and undertake some of this activism you’ve outlined. I guess in the end my offer was not something Momentum wanted to take up.</p> <p>The explosion of activity you talk about is clear for all to see in the pictures of the rallies. I can’t say it’s buzzing with Corbyn enthusiasm on the streets of Yardley yet. The movement people talk to me about is usually more about the movement of a lamp post or a parking obstruction.</p> <p>I worry deeply about outcomes of the children in my constituency, just as you do. I look around at all the local schools, nursery, primary and secondary. Some of them are in desperate need of investment; some were lucky enough to get it under the last Labour government. The tricky home lives of many of my constituents also worry me. Every week, I work with the dwindling workforce of the local children’s centres built by Labour. Together, we try to help families in terrible crisis. I worked in many local children’s centres while at Women’s Aid. I saw lives transformed. Futures changed. I used the services myself as a young mum – some face of the establishment I am. The services created by the last Labour government are under terrible threat, of that we can agree.</p> <p>Labour might not have felt like a transformative party to you, but the buildings, the resources, the lives of the people in my constituency and my life, in fact, were transformed by them. I’ll never forget the day my son qualified for his free nursery place. It meant that I could earn a proper wage again. My mother, born and bred in Yardley, had no such support when I was little, but then I was a Thatcher baby. Labour seem like a pretty good alternative to me.</p> <p>Labour governments matter, which is why I have to back our best chance of getting one and that is Owen Smith.</p> <p>Historic political party mandates don’t build schools. My bigger local membership is lovely; it hasn’t stopped my community centres closing. I admire what Momentum is trying to do. Where I live it hasn’t done any of what you describe. When I asked to go along to a meeting in Yardley I was told no, although people who have attended tell me my name comes up quite a lot.</p> <p>I desperately don’t want a Tory government – I want Labour to win. At the moment, the party isn’t speaking the language of the people who live in my constituency. I can guarantee you’d have to knock on many doors to find anyone who could tell you what this bold platform is. It’s not getting through. I’m certain we all have some blame in that.</p> <p>I’m terrified that we are not talking to people at the moment and only talk to ourselves. This will never win elections in marginal seats like mine. I don’t think Jeremy can hear me, let alone my constituents. The future and size of the party under Jeremy might look rosy, but the future of a Labour government, and with it, the things the kids in Yardley need, looks pretty bleak.<br /><em>Jess</em><br /></p> <h2><strong>Dear Jess</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>I do remember meeting you (sorry you missed your train) and remember sharing your concerns about how people in Yardley are coming under attack from Tory cuts. I remember our discussion on how difficult it was to help people link what is happening in their lives with politics and to allow them to believe that they can play a part in changing things. We discussed the split between the electorate and the Labour party and how it was apparent that the country did not believe that Labour had an economic plan that would do the job.</p> <p>I am sorry that you did not feel welcome to participate in Momentum. We found that many MPs who got involved found that it boosted local activity and many MPs and councillors were well supported by Momentum during the May elections this year. I also know that in your constituency members worked tirelessly with activists across the party spectrum to get local candidates elected.</p> <p>When we met in October, Jeremy had just chosen a pluralistic shadow cabinet that drove at presenting an alternative economic agenda. However, in the months that followed, being an effective opposition became more challenging as MPs briefed against Jeremy and the many new activists trying to engage with Labour at a community level were branded Trotskyists and entryists. With the constant undermining of the membership and movement, building a loving, diverse, inclusive and effective movement has been a challenge.</p> <p>Our experiences of the impact of a Labour government as opposed to a Tory one leads us both to the same conclusion – that a Labour government is the only vehicle for creating a more equal and just society. But this message has not resonated with communities across the country at the last two general elections and during that time Labour has not offered the anti-austerity opposition that people needed to protect their homes and services. Since then, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have continued to develop that anti-austerity, investment-led alternative. Their plan will rebalance the distribution of wealth and power in society and, given the massive increase in party membership, it is fair to say that this alternative is popular.</p> <p>Momentum and its activists are dedicated to the electoral success and development of the Labour party. The movement behind Jeremy is creating real change in the political system. The dual assets of radical policies and a movement that can popularise them is a strategy for winning. Activists are engaging communities in order to oppose cuts on the ground and inform people about Labour’s policies. The representative and inclusive party that we all want to see is developing as we nourish new members in the party and involve the previously disengaged.</p> <p>The movement is growing in numbers and appeal, but it is far from perfect. The fact that the streets of Yardley are not buzzing is not surprising. Engaging people in the way that Momentum is doing is not an overnight process. What I don’t understand is why the MPs are not getting behind this vision to make it work.</p> <p>I and other Labour supporters across the country fail to see how the agenda that Owen Smith is presenting offers a winning alternative, just as we fail to see how you abstaining on the welfare bill in 2015 helps protect the young people in your constituency.<br /><em>Emma</em><br /></p> <h2><strong>Dear Emma</strong></h2> <p>I think you miss the point. I did try to get behind Momentum, but it didn’t want me. Some unity. I agree it takes time to build a movement. In Yardley, we’ve inspired hundreds of volunteers. Most are not members of the party, just people who join in to help improve the lot of people and the area where they live. There is plenty of enthusiasm buzzing on the streets here for that. Amazing what you can achieve if you talk to people about stuff that matters to them rather than having your own agenda.</p> <p>I see you continue to peddle the line about the welfare bill. I think the decision of the Labour party at the time was wrong and misjudged. A bit like when Jeremy said we should trigger article 50 immediately or Momentum’s chair said: “In certain conditions one can see how it would be preferable to violate the minimum wage.” I’m think you’ll agree we all make mistakes that people can over-simplify to then discredit for their own agenda. I did vote against at the third reading, but you know that, don’t you?</p> <p>As one of the MPs who worked on the welfare bill committee I’m bit of an expert. I have letters of thanks from <a href=\"http://www.parkinsons.org.uk\" title=\"\">Parkinson’s UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk\" title=\"\">Child Poverty Action Group</a> praising me for the work I did to amend it. Thanks for my efforts in actually turning up to work for hours and hours over many weeks to change things. I can see that you prefer people to make a stand. I, on the other hand, like to make a change.</p> <p>I’ve had success at changing Tory welfare policy. I was part of the group that had people living in supported accommodation removed from the benefits cap, and subsequently universal credit. Currently, I’m working tirelessly with others to amend cuts to housing benefit for the same group. When Jeremy walked through the lobbies in parliament on the night of the second reading of the welfare bill, he changed nothing for the poor people in my constituency. He just made himself look good.</p> <p>I, on the other hand, have actually worked hard to do something to help the people who need it. It wasn’t rallies that won those wars – it was hours of negotiations and bringing people on board to apply pressure.</p> <p>If I am successful in my dogged campaign to protect housing benefit for people living in refuge, for care-leavers, for elderly people in supportive homes, Jeremy will claim it as his success. Before and after he became leader, I haven’t seen him rolling up his sleeves, I have never seen him in the meetings and I don’t remember him ever speaking about it or doing anything to help.</p> <p>Do you know who did turn up to the meetings, who has worked with John Healey and me trying to stop hundreds of women’s refuges and youth homelessness hostels from shutting? Owen Smith.</p> <p>I want to believe Jeremy can change things, not just hate things, but to date I’ve seen no evidence of this. I suppose the difference between Jeremy and Owen is one says stuff, the other does stuff. For the people who need us, I’ll take the latter.<br /><em>Jess</em><br /></p> <h2><strong>Dear Jess</strong></h2> <p>I am disappointed by your reply. Jeremy has spent more than three decades serving others and securing far more concrete improvements in people’s lives than I could begin to list in the 200 words I am given here. It is rather cynical to claim otherwise. One reason Jeremy has struck a chord with so many people is precisely because he has avoided these kind of Westminster games.</p> <p>It is clear that we share a lot of the same passions and concerns. But I remain unconvinced about how you think we will bring about the change in society we so desperately need.</p> <p>Labour’s strategy in recent years of trying to pitch its message at the “mythical median voter” has simply failed. Membership declined, two general elections were lost, along with huge swaths of support in Scotland and elsewhere.</p> <p>Instead, Labour must use its growing membership to organise in every community, drawing on the skills, experiences and creativity of ordinary people who want to be part of the solutions, not just victims of the problems. We need structural change to rebalance our society and this is now on Labour’s agenda.</p> <p>Momentum isn’t seeking to build a movement to protest and hold rallies. We need a movement to win power, enter government and be able to deliver transformative policies that will restructure our society to bring about a better life for everyone.</p> <p>I look forward to working with you after the election, whatever the outcome. There will be a great deal of work to do and we can’t afford to waste more time like this. <br /><em>Emma</em><br /></p> <h2><strong>Dear Emma</strong></h2> <p>I don’t doubt Jeremy has been a dutiful backbencher for years. It’s not a Westminster game to say that since I’ve been working fighting down the austerity measures, I have never seen Jeremy do anything but talk about it. The rest of us have tried to crack on and use the privilege we are given, by people, to use parliament for their advantage. Westminster is not a game, parliament is not a joke, the Labour party was created to be the parliamentary route to power for ordinary people.</p> <p>Your disappointment in me is similar to how I felt reading accounts of those in the shadow cabinet like <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/07/lilian-greenwood-mp-jeremy-corbyn-continually-undermined-me-job-i-loved\" title=\"\">Lilian Greenwood</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/heidi-alexander-attacks-john-mcdonnell-labour-nhs-policy\" title=\"\">Heidi Alexander </a>who Jeremy failed to listen to and failed to work with when they were trying to achieve actual change on our railways and in our health service.</p> <p>Of course I believe in creating a fairer society. I think income should be redistributed. I’m appalled that in Yardley only about 10 families benefit from inheritance tax cuts while thousands are made poorer by cuts to in-work benefits. I want equal pay, I want improved wages, I want it all. So does my seven-year-old, but we have to be grown up enough to do the difficult work to convince those who are not sure to come with us.</p> <p>You seemed to have missed the bit where I said that in Yardley we have exactly what you describe. We use members and volunteers to organise across our communities to achieve things like new services, community cohesion events, road safety initiatives.</p> <p>I’m happy to show Momentum how we did it. Perhaps this time you might take me upon it.</p> <p><em>Jess</em></p> <p>•<em> Comments will be opened later today</em></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"30","wordcount":"2811","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-16T23:03:20Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-13T14:42:19Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-13T23:03:20Z","internalComposerCode":"57af31cbe4b0178756b5c52a","internalOctopusCode":"11806682","internalPageCode":"2653192","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-14T10:14:31Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-14T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Very disappointed. People joined the Labour party in order to take part in the party and were specifically told that they were able to vote in the leadership election and that was decided by the high court that they could. The appeal court has said they can’t and I would imagine that those who brought the case will be considering whether or not to take it to the supreme court.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-tom-watson-talking-nonsense\">Jeremy Corbyn: Tom Watson is talking nonsense – and he knows it</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Will it affect the result?</strong></p> <p>Probably not, but I think that people should have the right to take part and that is surely what democracy is about. We now have the biggest membership in our history and I think we should be happy and joyful about that.</p> <p><strong>Tom Watson has raised fears of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">entryism in the Labour party</a>. He talked of “old hands twisting young arms” and has sent you a dossier of alleged evidence. How did you react?</strong><br /></p> <p>I read about his letter to me in the media and it appeared to be a rehash of a book Michael Crick wrote 20 years ago about alleged entryism into the Labour party at that stage. I just ask Tom to do the maths: 300,000 people have joined the Labour party – at no stage in anyone’s most vivid imagination are there 300,000 sectarian extremists at large in the country who have suddenly descended on the Labour party.</p> <p>Sorry Tom, it is nonsense – and I think he knows it’s nonsense. Let’s get on with campaigning, Tom. Thanks.</p> <p>I just wish that members of the parliamentary Labour party, including Tom, would recognise that we have a very strong and very large party membership who joined for a reason. They want a different kind of society and a different kind of Britain. They want us to oppose austerity, they want us to oppose inequality, they want us to encourage investment and that kind of society that develops that includes all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4dcaf250205f642ec202f86b95dcec57991dfcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4dcaf250205f642ec202f86b95dcec57991dfcc/0_257_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Tom’s letter appeared to be a rehash of a book Michael Crick wrote 20 years ago.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Has there been any entryism?</strong></p> <p>I haven’t noticed it and I have met very large numbers of new members at lots of events over the past year since I was elected. I have done fundraising events in every part of the country and it strikes me that there is a pleasing diversity of the people that have joined the party in terms of age, gender and ethnic background, ideas. It’s wonderful. I think we should welcome them. I don’t know why people get frightened of lots of new members. I am happy about it.</p> <p><strong>Is there a problem of people joining from other parties, including those who supported the Socialist Workers party?</strong><br /></p> <p>I want people to join for good motives. But if they have changed their political views or developed their political views, then surely that is a good thing. We can only win a general election by winning people over from non-voting or voting from another party. If someone has developed their politics to be members of the Labour party even though they were once members of the Lib Dems, or Greens or something, fine. Welcome aboard.</p> <p><strong>Have you got full confidence in Iain McNicol as general secretary?</strong><br /></p> <p>We will receive a report from Iain about the process that has gone on over the last few months. And the NEC [national executive council] will no doubt ask him questions and he will give answers on it. But let’s look at that when the new NEC takes over.</p> <p><strong>Do you think the Labour party HQ has been even-handed in its approach to the leadership contest?</strong><br /></p> <p>I say this: there will be a report on what has gone on. We’ll have that discussion. As far as I am concerned I am hoping that we can develop as a party where all members are able to take part in activities.</p> <p><strong>Do you have total confidence in Iain McNicol?</strong><br /></p> <p>I have been happy to work with Iain McNicol since I became leader.</p> <p><strong>But do you have full confidence in him?</strong><br /></p> <p>I have been happy to work with him.</p> <p><strong>You’re launching a plan for education in Britain. How will this reshape education?</strong><br /></p> <p>The idea is that we have an educational system that is wraparound and gives everyone opportunities. What we have got in Britain is a commodified education system where university and to some extent college education is concerned.</p> <p>We have insufficient access to preschool education for the youngest children. And we have a growing mix-up of secondary education between free schools and academies and local authority maintained schools. What we want is a national education concept that moves towards all children getting access to preschool facilities.</p> <p>We need a guarantee of class sizes of 30 or less in primary schools. There are a considerable number that are over 30, 31, some that are even bigger than that – up to 38 – and that is completely wrong. Therefore, we need more teachers, above all we need to retain more teachers. Sadly too many leave the profession very early because they are over-burdened by workloads and pressure on them. In secondary schools we have an increasing number of free schools and academies outside local authority orbit and the pay and conditions of the nationally agreed system. I am keen to re-establish local authorities as the family of education.</p> <p>We have also seen the sad demise of the once great adult education service in Britain, which was fantastic. Where local authorities would spend not very much money but get huge return for it. Adults could return to evening classes, night schools, weekend stuff where they could take degrees, study languages, study skills. Sometimes purely out of the joy of doing it. Sometimes for career development. I want to see a return to the levels of that and an extension of it. Then, of course, there is the question of university funding and the levels of fees. The government has finally ended the grant maintenance scheme altogether, which means that no student now gets any public support to go to university whatsoever. They have got to borrow for it and that means debt levels will rise. We have already seen a reduction in the number of students from working class and poor families going to university. I expect that is going to continue because they are raising the university fee cap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\" data-alt=\"Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/labour-vtories/giv-31075QMBH2Abui5aI/\">Polling data for Labour and the Conservatives</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Would you abolish tuition fees?</strong><br /></p> <p>That would be the aim, yes. And to bring back maintenance grants for those who need them. It’s going to be expensive, I understand that. But I also understand that as a society it works. A better educated society works for all of us and we will close the productivity gap by doing so. And we can look at countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/04/tuition-fees-germany-higher-education\">that don’t charge university fees such as Germany</a>, which has a much higher standard of university level education for the whole population as a result.</p> <p><strong>How do you fund that level of expenditure?</strong><br /></p> <p>It is expensive. We fund it through corporate taxation levels. By not reducing taxation and by chasing down tax avoidance and tax evasion.</p> <p><strong>Tax evasion. That won’t bring in enough to fund it …</strong><br /></p> <p>It brings in as much as we can get. But it means we have to deal with the system that encourages it. It’s costing us a lot of money not to have a higher level of higher education. If we invest in it we will benefit from it.</p> <p><strong>The RMT strikes, do you support them?</strong><br /></p> <p>I understand why they are doing it. Absolutely. Because in the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/southern-rail-dispute-thursday-and-friday-strikes-called-off\">Southern</a> the company has not fulfilled its obligations as far as I see it. The people who use Southern on the Brighton line are unbelievably angry about it. I am getting out-lefted by Tory MPs all down the line who want to take back the franchise, take the keys from Southern and give it over to Direct Rail. Direct Rail ran the north-east franchise extremely well. The exchequer got £600m out of it and instead it is now being handed over to Virgin and we have got overcrowding of mega proportions on the trains and we are not getting the same amount of money back.</p> <p><strong>Do you back the strikes on Southern and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/12/eurostar-strike-suspended-midnight-further-talks-rmt\">Eurostar</a>?</strong><br /></p> <p>Yes, because I understand why they are doing it.</p> <p>MPs and other critics have said that your message is too narrow. To get elected you will have to win seats from the SNP in Scotland, from Conservatives in the south and defend seats against Plaid in Wales and Ukip in the north. We are here in Sunderland where you have given a speech to 2,000 supporters which was very well received, and yet one of the local MPs, Sharon Hodgson, in her <a href=\"http://www.sharonhodgson.org/sharon_writes_to_local_labour_party_members_on_her_resignation_and_her_support_for_owen_smith_mp\">letter explaining why she was standing down</a> from the shadow frontbench, said: “To win a general election, we need to appeal to not only core Labour voters, but the wider electorate. Sadly, my experience on the doorstep across the country is that crucial swing voters will never vote for a labour government led by Jeremy, and I have experienced this on the doorstep in Washington and Sunderland West.”<br /></p> <p><strong>How are you going to reach out beyond the core to a wider electorate?</strong></p> <p>The appeal of our message has to be if you want real opportunities for everybody you have to invest in our society in a way that doesn’t increase inequality, which is what we have got at the moment. Essentially, the Tories have reduced corporate taxation, the top level of taxation, and cut services at the other end. And frozen public sector wages. Every family in Britain is affected in some way or another by the housing issue. At one end it is being homeless … At another level it is being unable to buy your first-time flat or home or anything else and having to stay with your parents until you are 30 or 40. We have a system that does not build or supply the houses that are necessary and, indeed, under the housing act forces councils to sell high-value properties in high cost areas. And so the housing issue affects pretty much everybody. Invest in housing that is good for everybody.</p> <p>Secondly, the NHS effects everybody. An NHS that is part-privatised, an NHS that is so underfunded that it ends up rationing expensive medicines and mental health services is so underfunded that many people go untreated. So my message is to those who do not consider themselves to be the poorest and vulnerable in society but relatively well off: you actually will benefit from a good health service.</p> <p><strong>But that messaging is not reflected in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">polling</a> … no one has ever won an election with polling as poor as yours. The message has not got out to a wide enough number of people.</strong><br /></p> <p>We have done our best to get our message out. It hasn’t been helped that prominent people in the Labour party – Labour MPs – have spent the last 10 months actively being unsupportive of our policies that have been generally agreed and supported. Now everyone agrees that anti-austerity is the right line to be taking.</p> <p>And since the resignations in July and the leadership contest, then clearly the public mind has become focused on the leadership contest rather than the future. I’m trying to turn this leadership campaign into a campaign of how we would run a general election. How we would win back those areas of Britain that have become disillusioned – left-behind Britain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b292998b73a47ffe162bfab10e32547ecd62c3ff/0_274_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘We are all selected and supported by the party.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You mentioned the discord in the party. Let’s talk about those MPs, many of whom are peeling away not for ideological reasons but for reasons of competence. Lilian Greenwood MP, in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/07/lilian-greenwood-mp-jeremy-corbyn-continually-undermined-me-job-i-loved\">explaining why she was resigning</a> from the shadow cabinet, said in a letter that: “[Jeremy] is not a team player let alone a team leader … he doesn’t understand collective responsibility and he can’t lead a team. This is not about policy or ideology, it is about competence.” She wrote of her frustration and upset that a policy launch on rail fares was undermined by the announcement of a shadow cabinet reshuffle that same day.</strong></p> <p>I am surprised that Lilian has taken this line. She and I sat down in her office with her team and we had a very good discussion about transport policies and we agreed a programme of activities. Why she should feel it necessary to write a letter like that at this moment she alone would know the answer to that.</p> <p><strong>But the reasons are in the letter: you announced a reshuffle on the day that the rail strategy that she had worked on for months was also being announced, and as a result it got buried by the reshuffle.</strong></p> <p>She knew full well that a reshuffle was happening at that time. Listen, choreography of news is not always the easiest thing to achieve. That was actually several months ago and so I have been happy to work with her and others and come the election result I will be happy to work with them again. And I hope that they will recognise that so far over 200 constituency parties have made a nomination for me as a leader of the party. That is far more than nominated me a year ago on a far greater, far higher level of participation by party members by those nominating at meetings. That is surely a sign of something.</p> <p><strong>But doesn’t this get to the heart of the problems in the Labour party in that some of those MPs will say that they get their mandate from their constituents and there are 9.4 million Labour voters. The MPs … say they don’t see you as an electable PM, so they are privileging loyalty to their constituents, which is a far greater number than the 500,000 or so Labour members.</strong><br /></p> <p>We all take our mandate from our constituents. I do as well.</p> <p><strong>So in that case it’s perfectly reasonable for MPs, who are taking soundings from voters, to say they are unwilling to support you as leader because they don’t see you as being electable as a prime minister.</strong></p> <p>Of course it is perfectly reasonable.</p> <p><strong>But why do you keep calling them out for their disloyalty? Especially as someone who was a serial disloyal Labour MP under previous Labour governments. You voted 438 times against Labour. </strong><br /></p> <p>No, I was standing for what I thought were very important principles such as on identity cards, such as on terrorism legislation, such as on the Iraq war, student fees. Those were the points of rebellion. I did not ever take any personal abuse or issues with anybody on the frontbench. I have never done that sort of politics, I never have.</p> <p><strong>No, but if these MPs feel as though their constituents will not be served by a Labour party that is not electable then it is a principled position for them to take, isn’t it?</strong><br /></p> <p>They can take a position, and they have done. And they are welcome to make the comments that they do. But I just remind them that we are all members of the Labour party. We are all selected and promoted and supported by members of the Labour party. And recruiting 300,000 people in a year has never ever been achieved before. I think some credit should be given where it is due. I would say to them, let’s understand that the mood out there has changed. People don’t want to live in an unequal society any more. There is thirst for real political change … People have had enough of neo-liberal economics and had enough of the politics of endless inequality.</p> <p><strong>You seem far more energised by this leadership campaign than by the European Union campaign. You have done 19 rallies in the leadership campaign. You did 10 in the EU referendum campaign. You seem to be enjoying this more than you did campaigning to stay in the EU.</strong><br /></p> <p>I did more media appearances than the whole of the shadow cabinet put together in the referendum campaign. I made the case for Remain recognising the problems that the EU had on competitive postal services, for example, and there is a debate about a free market direction of Europe and there is a debate about the social Europe – and I obviously choose the social Europe model and I voted against Maastricht. I strongly supported the social chapter, and I supported the workers’ time directive. Presumably Article 50 [of the Lisbon treaty] will be invoked at some point but we have to protect those advances but also ensure that we continue to gain market access. Here, in Sunderland, it relies very heavily on exports to Europe.</p> <p><strong>What is the right balance between public and private in the economy, do you think?</strong><br /></p> <p>What I want to see is properly funded public services and recognise the public services role in helping people in employment. There has to be a much greater public role in industry and development. We don’t shy away from the idea of investing in manufacturing industry. This country is very good at inventing things, discovering things, but very bad at developing things … linear motors, jet engines to some extent, tilting trains. We end up exporting the technology to somewhere else. If we had an effective national investment strategy we would be able to develop manufacturing process that goes with it.</p> <p>If we are to say to people: you invent something good, develop the manufacturing process as well … What happens now is that the banks won’t lend to them because they say it’s too risky, so a hedge fund comes along, buys the idea and then sells it somewhere else. And we end up developing the idea and losing the process. Can we not keep the process instead?</p> <p><strong>Do you want to take public ownership?</strong><br /></p> <p>No it’s about participation and partnerships … the straight public ownership we want to look at is the rail system, which these days has universal support in the Labour party.</p> <p><strong>Any others?</strong><br /></p> <p>The Royal Mail – it’s a crucial public service, it’s a natural monopoly. It is ludicrous the idea of competition in postal delivery.</p> <p><strong>This campaign is turning a little nasty. There was a lot of booing at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-debate-jeremy-corbyn-owen-smith-gateshead-live\">event last night</a>.</strong><br /></p> <p>People should treat other with respect. I don’t do abuse and I don’t think that anyone else should.

Why has it happened over the last 10 months?</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately there has always been nastiness in politics, There has always been abuse in politics. I regret it and I deplore it. And I deplore it if it has increased. It’s wrong.</p> <p><strong>Do you think it has increased?</strong><br /></p> <p>No. I am not sure it has. I know that I have received more abuse than I ever use to. But then maybe I’m better known these days. But I receive more abuse than anybody else. The best way of dealing with abuse is: ignore it.</p> <p>But MPs are saying they are on the receiving end of abuse and they can’t ignore it.<br /></p> <p>When there is racist abuse, misogynist abuse, threats against people – that is utterly, totally, completely wrong.</p> <p><strong>One of the reasons that the Labour party didn’t perform better last time around is that they were marked down on economic competence, and a lot of what you outlined today is seemingly of appeal to a lot of people … better childcare, a better funded NHS, more social housing. But a lot of people will ask, “Where is the money coming from?” How do you win the argument about economic competence?</strong><br /></p> <p>I think one of the problems that we had was that none of us did enough to explain why the economic crisis came about in 2008-09 and so we allowed the narrative to develop that the crash of 2008-09 was caused by alleged high levels of spending by that Labour government. It was absolutely nothing to do with it. It was much more to do with the subprime mortgage crisis in the USA, over-exposed banks and the lack of banking regulations.</p> <p>I think now everyone would agree with that but we allowed that narrative to develop that Labour crashed the economy, that it spent too much. The economy crashed because it wasn’t regulated enough.</p> <p>The other issue about competence is about how you deal with public investment. You either deal with it through very expensive PFI [private finance initiative] type funding – which ends up with a lack of public control and greater costs to the public – or you do it through traditional public investment through a public works loan board or a national investment bank, which gives better services for all.</p> <p><strong>Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?</strong><br /></p> <p>Well I can’t be with Trump, can I? I can’t be with Trump so obviously with Hillary.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"10","wordcount":"3549","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-16T22:30:00Z","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2016-08-13T19:34:02Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-13T22:28:49Z","internalComposerCode":"57af762ae4b0c23bfed89327","internalOctopusCode":"11808824","internalPageCode":"2653625","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-14T00:00:45Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-14T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Observer","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qm2b","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/8233556513d20127ea5541f6cf2d1fbffd33a503/0_51_4368_2621/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"350","internalShortId":"/p/4qm2b"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-interview-leadership-plots-nhs-education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-interview-leadership-plots-nhs-education","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn interview: ‘There are not 300,000 sectarian extremists at large’","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-13T22:28:49Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/2016/aug/13/jeremy-corbyn-interview-leadership-plots-nhs-education","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2655190","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"4b0da356ed1c3942dae5fbd3a742c0ba332a35d6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b0da356ed1c3942dae5fbd3a742c0ba332a35d6/0_189_3000_1800/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Pupil's hands and book","caption":"‘Jeremy Corbyn’s proposed national education service starts with a principle that sounds like common sense: education is a public good.

It’s not that I don’t believe she’ll do it, since if there’s one thing this party has proved beyond doubt, it’s its determination to enact ideas about which I initially assumed it was joking. It’s not that I don’t think grammar schools are an appalling idea, nor that I don’t mind when a prime minister ignores reason and evidence in favour of cant and nostalgia.</p> <p>Rather, it’s the knowledge that this conversation isn’t about education, it’s just a badge that says: “I believe in grammar schools because I’m a one-nation Conservative. Broadly, I think things were better in the olden days, when a grammar school could lift a child from a life of circus drudgery and anoint him prime minister, and I’m prepared to overlook the fact that the grammar school of this parable actually supplied John Major with no more than three O-levels and today would be in special measures. The fact that grammar schools don’t deliver meaningful mobility is less important than what it says about me that I believe in them.”</p> <p>This is comfort-blanket politics, with debating points as familiar as the seasons. It is a reassuring balm to the faithful, and a closed conversation to which unbelievers aren’t invited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/07/senior-tories-likely-to-resist-theresa-mays-grammar-schools-agenda\">Theresa May's grammar schools plan faces cross-party backlash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s a similar impetus behind Labour leadership contender Owen Smith’s promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/owen-smith-labour-education-policy\" title=\"\">end the tax breaks private schools</a> enjoy because of their charitable status. This is the classic identifier of the reformer who doesn’t intend to frighten any horses: “I’m not against private education per se. I just don’t think it’s strictly speaking third sector work, to hive off the children of the rich, the better to endow them with a sense of entitlement. I’m not sure this is what charity is supposed to be all about. Correct me if I’m wrong! I’m a reasonable man.”</p> <p>The reassurance is textured: Smith’s is no simple rejection of elitism, but rather, a promise to tackle privilege in the most modest, incremental and – fundamentally – unarguable way.</p> <p>Contrast the intentions of Michael Gove, in his time as education secretary. It seems ever plainer, with more distance, that Gove was trying to transmute the UK’s academy system into a wholesale mimicry of American charter schools: local governance was inherently complacent, unions were the enemy, the pillars of decent education were defined by people who thought it could be counted in units.</p> <p>It was inevitable that, once the people with experience and expertise were sidelined, corruption and incompetence would sneak in. It was only to be expected that teacher morale would be bled dry – the new thinking painted the entire profession as an enemy of ambition.</p> <p>You can say what you like about all this – I think it’s one of the most destructive things the Conservatives have done, against some awe-inspiring competition – but there was nothing soothing about it. Its platitudes were a mask for radicalism rather than an end in themselves. Gove’s job, which he did magnificently well, was always to hide how revolutionary it was. Any progressive force against that has to marshal the same energy.</p> <p>This is why Jeremy Corbyn’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/education/schools/news/78136/jeremy-corbyn-outlines-lifelong-national-education-service-plan\" title=\"\">national education service</a>, even while its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_through_labor\" title=\"\">Maoist overtones</a> are so strong, is so impressive. It starts with a principle that sounds like common sense: education is a public good. Learning should be provided from cradle to grave, as health is. An ambitious and courageous state knows the wealth of the nation is in its people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An ambitious and courageous state knows that the wealth of the nation is in its people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From there, it goes to universal free childcare, an idea that all parties have periodically attached themselves to, and a classic New Labour manoeuvre, where any thought deemed too redistributive found broad acceptability wrapped in a nappy: hence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/12/sure-start-childrens-centres-face-worst-year-of-budget-cuts\" title=\"\">Sure Start</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/childtrustfunds\" title=\"\">child trust fund</a>, the child poverty target.</p> <p>Next, Corbyn pledges decent schools for all, including class sizes of under 30, an idea so universal that the only question it raises is why it’s not already the case. Even free tertiary education, the idea with the leftiest pedigree, does not go against established thinking. The status of tuition fees as the natural order of things is very recent: it’s not long at all since Nick Clegg believed in free universities. It was, astonishingly, only 2003 when Iain Duncan Smith called Tony Blair’s hike of tuition fees to £3,000 a “tax on learning”.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/education-34132664\" title=\"\">Free tertiary education</a> is also the issue on which progressive movements in Europe have had the most striking success; and in this Corbyn echoes Blair’s breakthrough on the NHS in 2000, when he argued to increase health spending, not because he loved waste, but because if they could afford a higher per capita spend in Europe, why couldn’t we?</p> <p>It’s a terribly elegant argument, marrying social generosity with a pride in British exceptionalism, which must have something for pretty much everyone. Once you’ve accepted that, the promise of maintenance grants sounds like a detail. Finally, the promise of investment in adult education is a platitude – who could possibly want adults to be less skilled, less fulfilled, than they could be? – that masks a huge shift in priorities. Further education, known in the political class as what happens to other people’s children, has been underfunded for nearly a decade.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/13/quarter-of-graduates-are-low-earners\">Quarter of UK graduates are low earners 10 years after university</a> </p> </aside>  <p>FE colleges have been appropriated to become ill-starred academies, and places on English and literacy courses for adults have been slashed. To reverse this would be life-changing for the least privileged: and yet it arrives as a very anodyne notion, that learning should be lifelong, an idea from neither the left nor the right, but the civilised mind.</p> <p>It will naturally be met with a critique of its affordability, but here the Conservatives have set new mood music that they may live to find rather grating: they have never approached education through an economic lens, never paraded academies as a saving, never brooked any interrogation over how much their reforms cost. Even tuition fees were sold as a fairness issue – why should the bin man pay for the accountant’s daughter to study classics? – rather than austerity. It will be a move of pleasing jujitsu if Labour can use this lofty language to create a new normal.</p> <p>More bolstering, though, would be a new phase of thinking. I hold out very little hope it will heal the rifts of the party, and am no better persuaded that the existing Labour MPs have to be vanquished rather than included. But as thinking, it is far more interesting than the rather lackadaisical cushion-plumping going on elsewhere.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"25","wordcount":"1122","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-17T17:06:33Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-14T12:57:49Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-14T17:06:33Z","internalComposerCode":"57b06acde4b062ce4d2233e7","internalOctopusCode":"11810178","internalPageCode":"2655190","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-14T21:00:14Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

The decision means that about 130,000 members who joined less than six months ago will not be able to vote in the election.</p> <p>More than £93,000 had been raised on the members’ crowdfunding website, but Fordham <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.crowdjustice.co.uk/case/labour-party-membership/\">wrote on Sunday</a> that they had decided not to appeal directly to the UK’s highest court, citing the costs involved.</p> <p>“This has been an odd, emotional rollercoaster of a week for us all,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, given the costs involved in pursuing the case further (the fee for getting the case even heard at the supreme court is around £8,000), we have taken the decision that this is where this particular legal case has to stop.”</p> <p>The fee for an application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court is £1,000.</p> <p>Fordham said the case “wasn’t in vain, although we didn’t succeed in reclaiming votes for the 130,000 disenfranchised members, we did win in the high court, exposing facts which have spurred important conversations about the role of the Labour party membership and the NEC.”</p> <p>She said the costs the group had been ordered to pay, which came to about £80,000, plus their legal fees, would be covered if the crowdfund reached its £100,000 target.</p> <p>“The fight for justice isn’t over yet, although this particular stage of it is over,” she said. “The five of us are going to stay in the party and work to try and change things for the better within the party’s structure itself.”</p> <p>Corbyn’s team, which had vocally supported the legal challenge and criticised the court of appeal judges, said the cash raised showed “the strength of solidarity shown to the five claimants campaigning for the democratic rights of their fellow Labour party members has been truly remarkable”.</p> <p>“It is clear that there exists huge amount of support for Jeremy’s vision of a democratic Labour party that is open and inclusive for all, so that we can achieve a Labour government that can transform and rebuild Britain, so that nowhere and no one is left behind,” a campaign spokesman said.</p> <p>After the court decision on Friday, Corbyn’s team <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/12/corbyns-team-incensed-as-new-members-denied-labour-vote-again\">described the decision</a> as wrong “both legally and democratically”.</p>","wordcount":"574","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-17T14:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-14T13:26:11Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-14T14:01:18Z","internalComposerCode":"57b07173e4b0c23bfed8960a","internalPageCode":"2655236","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-14T15:45:12Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qz82","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d28488b3ad0df252d22a3c60cba3590b39f9aa96/218_0_4282_2570/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"452","internalShortId":"/p/4qz82"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/14/labour-party-members-leadership-election-challenge-supreme-court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/14/labour-party-members-leadership-election-challenge-supreme-court","webTitle":"Labour members will not take leadership vote challenge to supreme court","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-14T14:01:18Z","sectionName":"Politics","sectionId":"politics","type":"article","id":"politics/2016/aug/14/labour-party-members-leadership-election-challenge-supreme-court","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","editions":[{"id":"politics","webTitle":"Politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2650881","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"e39ed1438befd51e20b12afd207271dbc66a06ba","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39ed1438befd51e20b12afd207271dbc66a06ba/0_581_3512_2107/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith","caption":"Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith.

However, Labour party’s general secretary, Iain McNicol, also made it clear in evidence that there have been concerns about a subversion of the voting process, with members joining with the sole purpose of voting in the election rather than participating in the party more widely.</p> <h2>Will the court of appeal’s ruling be challenged?</h2> <p>The appeal judges refused the five Labour members who originally challenged the NEC leave to appeal to the supreme court and ordered them to pay costs. However, the five members’ lawyers can still ask the supreme court justices directly to consider their case. David Goldstone QC, who had represented the five, indicated in court that steps had already been taken which could lead to a hearing next Tuesday.</p> <h2>What does the verdict mean in monetary terms?</h2> <p>Potentially a very large bill for the five new members who brought the case. They must pay £30,000 towards the NEC’s costs, which are £60,000 in total, within 28 days. The party itself also avoids a bill for refunding all of the excluded new members who had also later paid the £25. This had been estimated to be in the region of £1.25m.</p> <h2>How likely is the ruling to impact on the final result of the leadership contest?</h2> <p>Supporters of both Corbyn and Smith believe that the majority of the 130,000 who joined in the weeks running up to the beginning of the challenge against Corbyn have done so to back the current leader.

We as a party have got to come together. </p> <p>“In relation to what the party has got to do, it’s got to be able to present to the public coherent unified prospectus for government, if we can’t do that then we are divided and we are incredibly vulnerable.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba6e21542d653acd0ebfee13dd64136412e7cde7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba6e21542d653acd0ebfee13dd64136412e7cde7/0_201_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Falconer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Falconer said the Labour party had to present a coherent case for government to the public otherwise it would be ‘incredibly vulnerable’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Responding to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/tom-watson-sends-corbyn-proof-of-trotskyist-labour-infiltration\">claims by the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson</a>, that Trotskyist entryists have infiltrated the party, Falconer said: “The vast vast majority of new members have nothing to do with Trotskyist entryists, 99.99% have joined because they want a new politics that we as a party can completely reflect.</p> <p>“I’m sure there may be some individuals who are old Trots, old members of Militant, who were expelled in the 80s who are using the wholly new situation in the Labour party to come back.

It’s a fact.”</p> <p>The Socialist party’s leader, Peter Taaffe, a founder member of Militant who has continued to be involved since the 1980s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/leader-expelled-leftwing-group-militant-peter-taaffe-readmission-labour-corbyn\">told the Guardian</a> earlier in the day that he hoped to be readmitted to the Labour party if Corbyn saw off the leadership challenge from Smith.</p> <p>He said Corbyn was opening Labour up “to all strands of socialist and working class opinion” and rejecting control of the party by a “top-down, centralised elite”. He added: “The lava of this revolution is still hot.”</p> <p>The Socialist party <a href=\"http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/articles/23328\">published an editorial</a> on Tuesday that argued for a Labour split, even if it meant the party was left with just 20 MPs. “The civil war, now it is out in the open, cannot be simply called off,” the editorial said.</p> <p>Taaffe said: “[Watson] is referring to entryists, but we were not entryists, we were born in the Labour party, and we were expelled because we fought Thatcher in Liverpool and defeated her.” He insisted that Labour MPs critical of Corbyn could not “stop the winds of history as they’re developing at the moment”.</p> <p>Smith’s campaign received a fillip on Wednesday when he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/10/gmb-union-backs-owen-smith-labour-leader\">endorsed by the GMB union</a> after he won a ballot of its members by 60% to 40%. Its general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “GMB members cannot afford for Labour to be talking to itself in a bubble for the next five years while the Tories run riot through our rights at work, our public services and our communities.”</p> <p>Corbyn’s allies blame the result on “GMB political officers close to Watson” and claimed that the ballot question – “Who do you think is best placed to lead the Labour party to a general election victory and serve as prime minister?” – was a leading one because it made reference to electability.</p> <p>The former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie ridiculed that claim. “If you don’t think you can be considered as a potential future prime minister, then what sort of leadership are you talking about? This boils it right down to whether we just want to be some sort of protest movement,” he said.</p>","wordcount":"1339","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-14T06:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-11T06:21:18Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T06:49:37Z","internalComposerCode":"57ac195ee4b024cdec3d6760","internalPageCode":"2647031","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-11T23:26:17Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4qdx5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f5a98b398a2cfb07a3132712bb00c6cef495a3/0_230_3500_2101/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"502","internalShortId":"/p/4qdx5"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-vote-dispute-appeal-court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/labour-leadership-vote-dispute-appeal-court","webTitle":"Labour

However, only around 30,000 of the GMB’s 639,000 members are eligible to actually vote in the Labour leadership election – those who pay into the union’s political fund.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-endorses-owen-smith-for-labour-leader\">Ed Miliband urges Labour members to vote for Owen Smith</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tim Roache, the union’s general secretary, said it was time for the union to “face up to reality” and said he would now campaign alongside Smith. “The Labour party is at a crossroads,” he said. “I’m under no illusions that we’re living through dangerous political times – the like of which I haven’t seen during my three decades in our movement.”<br /></p> <p>Sources in the Corbyn campaign said the endorsement had been expected, and also claimed the ballot question had been loaded against the Labour leader because it focussed on electability, a key component of Smith’s campaign.</p> <p>The ballot had asked: “Who do you think is best placed to lead the Labour party to a general election victory and serve as prime minister?”</p> <p>Roache said he had been determined that members should be balloted before the union decided who to endorse. “I’ll proudly campaign alongside Owen in the coming weeks and months to deliver on his pledges to end the public sector pay freeze, to support defence workers, to invest in health and industry, and to build an industrial strategy – these are bread and butter issues for the people I represent,” Roache said. </p> <p>“But we can only tackle them if we’re in government. That’s the endgame and I hope, whatever the final result, the Labour party will unite when all this is over. GMB members cannot afford for Labour to be talking to itself in a bubble for the next five years while the Tories run riot through our rights at work, our public services and our communities.” </p> <p>Sir Paul Kenny, who recently retired as boss of the GMB, has said he will vote for Smith.</p> <p>Smith said it was a great honour to receive GMB’s nomination to be the next Labour leader. “At the heart of my campaign are commitments to strengthening our trade unions, ending exploitation and delivering greater equality,” he said. </p> <p>“I look forward to working with the GMB, its members and all in the labour movement to tackle inequality, invest in strong public services, and for Britain to have trade union and workers’ rights that are the envy of the world.”</p> <p>A Corbyn campaign source said of the result: “This is not unexpected, we heard that there had been a well-funded and orchestrated effort from certain rightwing political officers at the GMB close to [Labour’s deputy leader, Tom] Watson and Smith.</p> <p>“But we still have the majority of affiliated trade union support and we didn’t have the GMB’s nomination last year and we still won.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" />A source on Smith’s campaign said they saw the endorsement as particularly significant given the result was a full ballot of members. Referencing the YouGov poll of trade union members last month, which showed a dampening of support for Jeremy Corbyn, the source said: “Our guess is that is why other unions are not doing it, at worst it would be a split and at best there would be backing for Owen.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Smith has actively courted an endorsement from the GMB, meeting local activists in Barnsley on Tuesday at the distribution site for online fashion retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asos\">Asos</a> on Tuesday.<br /></p> <p>The MP has written to the chair of the business, innovation and skills Select committee, Iain Wright, asking him to investigate the situation for zero-hours contract staff at the warehouse. </p> <p>In a post on his website, Smith said: “Insecurity, low-pay and poor working conditions are an increasing reality for many working people in Britain, as we have seen most recently at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a>. At the moment, workers in this country have some of the least rights in Europe. As Labour leader I would campaign to change that and make sure we have workplace protections that are the finest in the world.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/\">Unison</a>, the UK’s

team has told members of the Labour leader’s own constituency party that Labour is heading for a defeat similar to its catastrophically heavy 1931 loss if Corbyn remains at the helm.</p> <p>Neale Coleman, who is now working as an adviser to Corbyn’s challenger, Owen Smith, was speaking at a meeting of the Islington North constituency Labour party, where members voted to nominate Corbyn as their choice in the Labour leadership contest by a margin of 266 votes to 100.</p> <p>While the nomination is purely symbolic and has no direct impact on the leadership election, the meeting at a church hall in the Labour leader’s constituency heard passionate speeches for both candidates.</p> <p>Coleman, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/21/neale-coleman-quit-jeremy-corbyn-labour-sidelined-policy\">resigned earlier this year as Corbyn’s head of policy and rebuttal</a> amid reports of divisions within the leader’s office, said he had been delighted to vote for him last year.</p> <p>However, he said experience had taught him that Corbyn was not the right person to lead the party, and Labour faced defeat on the same level as 1931 if he remained in charge. The election in that year resulted in a landslide victory for a Tory-led coalition while the Labour party took only 52 seats, 225 fewer than in 1929.</p> <p>Coleman urged members to watch a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/video/jeremy-corbyn-the-outsider\">fly-on-the-wall documentary</a> by Vice that gave an insight into the workings of the Labour leader’s office and which was seized on by critics.</p> <p>However, there were also passionate appeals for members to support Corbyn, with local members citing his strengths as a local campaigning MP. </p> <p>Others highlighted Smith’s past as a lobbyist in the pharmaceuticals industry and criticised members of the parliamentary Labour party, claiming that “neoliberalism” was at the heart of the New Labour project.</p> <p>One man said the choice in the leadership contest was between principles and commitment on the one hand and insincerity and opportunism on the other.</p> <p>The meeting heard suggestions that Corbyn had not been fully engaged in the campaign to secure a remain vote in the referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. A woman who said she had been an organiser for the Stronger In campaign in Islington said it had been “nearly impossible” to get Corbyn involved.<br /></p> <p>There were shouts of “rubbish” from others as it was claimed that the Labour leader had been “absent without leave” during the referendum campaign. Corbyn’s team have repeatedly insisted that the Labour leader campaigned hard for the remain side.<br /></p> <p>Corbyn subsequently tweeted a picture of himself celebrating with members of the CLP at a nearby pub, adding that he was looking forward to working with its members in the years ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/763486307058323456\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Proud to be nominated by my own CLP with a turnout of 370.
