Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May’s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK’s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China’s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/hs2-bidding-process-opened-up-chinese-companies\">contracts worth nearly £12bn</a> to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands.</p> <p>A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\">10% of Heathrow Holdings</a> is owned by CIC.</p> <p><strong>Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Fears about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">allowing China such close involvement</a> with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour\">members of the intelligence community</a>. </p> <p>One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain’s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row.</p> <p>It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">independent cybersecurity experts</a>, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell.</p> <p><strong>Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\">blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co</a> to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China’s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman’s land is close to a nuclear testing site.</p> <p>Huawei was also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-huawei-nbn-idUSBRE82P0GA20120326\">barred from tendering</a> to take part in Australia’s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout.</p> <p>The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage.</p> <p>Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat\">threat to national security</a> by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon.</p> <p><strong>Why does China like the UK so much?</strong></p> <p>Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made.</p> <p>But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. </p> <p>Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-zhou-idUSBREA2T02S20140330\">appropriated by the state</a>. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/22/china-cambridge-university-poet-xu-zhimo-farewell-property\">put more than $12bn</a> into UK property, nearly a third of the country’s overall investment in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"1209","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T13:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T11:01:58Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9b826e4b0f5d064841c30","internalPageCode":"2641918","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:32:13Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q6vm","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"804","internalShortId":"/p/4q6vm"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webTitle":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","type":"article","id":"business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","editions":[{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","code":"default"},{"id":"uk/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/business","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/business","code":"us"},{"id":"au/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/business","code":"au"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[{"packageId":"f07e3ceb-03fb-4948-b3c5-8f419870e9b6","articles":[{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2641918","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"An employee stands next to the Chinese and British flags","caption":"An employee stands next to the Chinese and British flags at the Bank of China in Beijing.

Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay.</p> <p><strong>Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/broker-tells-investors-sell-edf-shares-hinkley-point-costs\">under significant financial stress</a>. </p> <p>That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May’s biggest concerns.</p> <p><strong>Why is the UK courting Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/uk-current-account-deficit-deepens-brexit-fears\">UK’s current account deficit</a> was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/uk-economy-growth-record-trade-deficit\">record high of 7.2%</a> in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus.</p> <p>Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34341352\">owed their existence to China</a>.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/government-says-links-with-china-are-vital-after-hinkley-point-warning\">Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What does China own in the UK?</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\" data-alt=\"Comparison with France, Germany and Italy\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/08/china-directinvestment/giv-31075W7oHdNK0jqv6/\">Comparison with France, Germany and Italy</a> </figure>  <p>While the UK is not one of China’s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined.

This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England.</p> <p><strong>What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash?</strong></p> <p>Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/24/hs2-bidding-process-opened-up-chinese-companies\">contracts worth nearly £12bn</a> to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands.</p> <p>A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow\">10% of Heathrow Holdings</a> is owned by CIC.</p> <p><strong>Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Fears about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">allowing China such close involvement</a> with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point.</p> <p>The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour\">members of the intelligence community</a>. </p> <p>One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain’s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row.</p> <p>It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking\">independent cybersecurity experts</a>, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell.</p> <p><strong>Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment?</strong></p> <p>Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/29/australian-treasurer-overrules-sale-of-13-of-country-to-chinese-firm\">blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co</a> to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China’s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman’s land is close to a nuclear testing site.</p> <p>Huawei was also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-huawei-nbn-idUSBRE82P0GA20120326\">barred from tendering</a> to take part in Australia’s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout.</p> <p>The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage.</p> <p>Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat\">threat to national security</a> by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon.</p> <p><strong>Why does China like the UK so much?</strong></p> <p>Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made.</p> <p>But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. </p> <p>Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-zhou-idUSBREA2T02S20140330\">appropriated by the state</a>. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/22/china-cambridge-university-poet-xu-zhimo-farewell-property\">put more than $12bn</a> into UK property, nearly a third of the country’s overall investment in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"1209","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-12T13:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-09T11:01:58Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","internalComposerCode":"57a9b826e4b0f5d064841c30","internalPageCode":"2641918","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T15:32:13Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q6vm","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be515b955dca7d9d6671fdf2299acfbc6fbac0c/0_333_5000_3000/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"804","internalShortId":"/p/4q6vm"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","webTitle":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","sectionName":"Business","sectionId":"business","type":"article","id":"business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","editions":[{"id":"business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business","code":"default"},{"id":"uk/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/business","code":"uk"},{"id":"us/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us/business","code":"us"},{"id":"au/business","webTitle":"Business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/au/business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/au/business","code":"au"}]},"isHosted":false}},{"metadata":{"id":"internal-code/page/2642041","articleType":"article","group":"included"},"content":{"references":[{"id":"rich-link/https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-uk","type":"rich-link"}],"elements":[{"id":"c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3432cc25943742eabf69d52b8896992e9fbdfca/938_1152_1580_949/140.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Clouds over Hinkley Point A and B","caption":"Clouds over Hinkley Point A and B.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-why-has-government-delayed-final-approval\">after the British government’s decision last month to delay final approval of the project</a>, which is receiving major financial support from China.</p> <p>“If Britain’s openness is a condition for bilateral co-operation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built,” Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times, in which he placed the project at the centre of Britain’s evolving trade relationship with China.<br /></p> <p>“Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.”<br /></p> <p>The prime minister Theresa May is thought to have ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">delay</a> owing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">concerns about the role of China General Nuclear</a>, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project. Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure.</p> <p>While not specifically addressing those concerns, Liu said that “security” was central to the debate surrounding the project, adding that the UK has “a state-of-the-art supervision regime and legal system”.</p> <p>The article comes in the wake of wider doubts about the future of the close relationship with China that David Cameron and George Osborne had heavily promoted. </p> <p>The ambassador, who said that Chinese companies have invested more in the UK than in Germany, France and Italy combined over the past five years, concluded by stating that it “has not been easy for China and the UK to have come this far”.</p> <p>“As long as both sides cherish what has been achieved and continue to expand and deepen our co-operation across the board, bilateral relations will maintain their strong momentum and work for the wellbeing of both the Chinese and British people,” Liu said.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/08/for-a-secure-energy-future-there-are-far-better-investments-than-hinkley\">For a secure energy future, there are far better investments than Hinkley | John Sauven</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, French unions have said that the decision by energy firm EDF to invest in Hinkley Point<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/edf-decision-hinkley-point-should-be-declared-void-french-unions-government-approval-nuclear\"> should be declared invalid.</a><br /></p> <p>Three unions at the French state-owned firm said senior board members knew the British government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. </p> <p>Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, wrote to board members last week, saying he knew about the delay before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear site in a generation. Just hours before a signing ceremony was due to take place at the site in Somerset May quashed hopes that Hinkley would go ahead by putting off government approval until early autumn.</p> <p>Unions said they believed some board members knew of the likely delay, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned. “Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” they said in a joint statement.</p> <p>“They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.” </p> <p>The unions, CGT, CFE-CGC and FO, said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement.</p> <p>But Lévy told executives he believed May only wanted a few more days, and EDF said he had not been aware of any plan to push back the decision to autumn. EDF said it knew at the time of the boardroom vote only that a signing ceremony planned for the day after the meeting was to be delayed.</p> <p>“Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the Hinkley Point project,” EDF said.</p> <p>“All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on July 28 was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday, 29 July, would be postponed.</p> <p>“This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.”</p>","wordcount":"798","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-11T22:30:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-08-08T20:44:55Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T22:31:10Z","internalComposerCode":"57a8ef47e4b033cb0795e2f6","internalOctopusCode":"11793107","internalPageCode":"2640564","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-09T08:46:31Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4q44t","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/852e242950d61fca0380afb3eaf190618f00c7ef/1054_423_2677_1606/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"614","internalShortId":"/p/4q44t"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/china-warns-uk-relations-historical-juncture-hinkley-point-liu-xiaoming","webTitle":"China

before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear power plant in a generation. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:

</aside>  <p>Theresa May quashed hopes that Hinkley would finally go ahead at last when it was announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">that final government approval would be postponed until early autumn</a>. The announcement came just hours before a signing ceremony was scheduled to take place at the site in Somerset, south-west England.</p> <p>The prime minister is thought to have ordered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">delay</a> owing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">concerns about the role of China General Nuclear</a>, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project.</p> <p>Unions said they believed some EDF board members knew the delay was probable, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned.</p> <p>“Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” said the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO in a joint statement. “They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.”</p> <p>The three unions said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement. </p> <p>In his letter to fellow EDF executives Lévy said he believed May only wanted “a few more days” to consider the Hinkley contract amid criticism over the cost to taxpayers. </p> <p>EDF said this week: “Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/hinkley-point-c\">Hinkley Point project</a>.</p> <p>“All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on 28 July was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday 29 July would be postponed.</p> <p>“This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.”</p> <p>EDF added that Lévy planned to sue the Sud Energie union, after it claimed that he lied when he told journalists he did not know the British government was planning to delay the project.</p> <p>The CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said not enough consideration was given to whether EDF board members were subject to a conflict of interest, because some are employed by companies that stand to benefit from Hinkley.</p> <p>“Who can say that with a rigorous management of the conflicts of interest and real transparency of information, the board decision would not have been different,” the unions said.</p> <p>Peter Atherton, an associate at Cornwall Energy consultants, said: “It would seem that communication between the two parties [the UK government and EDF] wasn’t the best.”</p> <p>He added that the cost of underwriting the project for UK taxpayers was excessive, after the government agreed a guaranteed price for electricity produced by Hinkley. “My position is that the economics of Hinkley are very hard to justify. The question is whether there are other benefits, such as the relationship with the French and Chinese and the industrial development you get from that, as well as economic benefits to the south-west.”</p> <p>Critics of Hinkley have argued that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-bad-business-theresa-may-david-cameron\">not good value for money</a> because the government is offering EDF – which is 85%-owned by the French state – a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour to provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs.</p> <p>Atherton said: “The political will in the UK may have diminished now that George Osborne isn’t involved. The issue is whether the whole thing is being called into question.”</p> <p>Oliver Salvesen, equity analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said there was still enough support for Hinkley within EDF for the project to go ahead, assuming the UK government chooses to support it.</p> <p>“It is surprising that the company can’t marry these two factions together. It’s a function of the fact that EDF has been very financially stressed because of poor market conditions,” he said.</p> <p>“The unions are very powerful and they’ll want to know that the company isn’t taking on unnecessary risk with an investment that could impact the French business and of course, the workforce. But this is a long-term project that they want to be involved with and will give very decent returns.”</p> <p>The UK government is conducting a review of the Hinkley Pointcontract, but it has not made public its scope of the review. </p> <p>May is thought to have been keen to examine more closely the <a

</figure>","body":"<p>Britain’s nuclear watchdog was made to wait more than a fortnight for key files from energy giant EDF confirming that components recently revealed to be suspect had not been used in one of Britain’s largest nuclear power stations.</p> <p>Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in early May, France’s EDF Group initially rebuffed requests from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to hand over files about a foundry in France that made specialist parts for EDF’s reactors. The request followed a shock announcement by the foundry’s owner, Areva, on 2 May that quality control reports could have been falsified. The email trail shows the ONR was still making requests for a components list on 18 May, 16 days after the safety fears were first aired.</p> <p>Dr David Lowry of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies, who obtained the emails, said they raised questions about the regulator’s powers. “ONR has run into so many difficulties in obtaining safety documentation from the French nuclear industry. How will it obtain key documents from the notoriously secretive Chinese nuclear industry, if they get permission to build their own reactors at Bradwell, on the Blackwater Estuary in Essex?”</p> <p>The UK regulator feared that the suspect Areva components might have been used in the construction of Suffolk’s Sizewell B power station and that others were destined for the proposed Hinkley Point C in Somerset.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/2016/Anomalies-suspected-falsifications-Areva/\">Greenpeace France claimed that “the potential falsifications and anomalies” </a>constituted “a major safety risk because the parts involved are large components which are essential to operating the reactors”.</p> <p>When the concerns emerged, an ONR spokesman said: “ONR is aware of the reports of possible falsification of manufacturing and quality control at Areva’s reactor vessel plant at Le Creusot. We have been in contact with the licensee and are looking into any applicability in the UK.”</p> <p>But emails suggest that the watchdog struggled to obtain information from the French company’s UK subsidiary, EDF Energy, to enable it to make an urgent safety assessment.</p> <p>An email from the ONR dated 13 May states: “We have been in contact with EDF Group and while they do have access to the Areva component files, they are not able to release them to EDF Energy.”</p> <p>The watchdog said EDF had informally advised it that none of the components in Sizewell B posed a safety risk. But, without access to the files, it had to rely on the French firm’s assurances.</p> <p>The ONR’s chief nuclear inspector wrote in desperation on 18 May to his counterpart at ASN, France’s nuclear watchdog,. “I am concerned that without sight of the full list of implicated components supplied to the UK it is not possible for ONR to independently verify the UK position,” he wrote.</p> <p>The ONR was left having to ask its French counterpart for a list of the suspect components or to “facilitate Areva sending the list directly to ONR”.

as the country’s official news agency questioned the British government’s delay in approving the controversial new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant.</p> <p>Xinhua news agency said China understood and respected Britain’s requirement for more time to think about the deal, but it dismissed fears that China would put “backdoors” into the technology used on the project, that might present threats to UK national security.</p> <p>It said: “China can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions, but cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for win-win cooperation.”</p> <p>Xinhua commentaries are not official government statements, although they are often viewed as offering a taste of the regime’s thinking.</p> <aside

Point, says ex-minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The article came after the British prime minister was reported to have previously voiced concerns about the security implications of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/01/osborne-rejected-safeguards-over-chinese-role-in-hinkley-point-says-ex-energy-minister\">planned Chinese investment</a> at Hinkley Point, views which emerged following her government’s surprise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/government-seeks-to-reassure-investors-as-hinkley-point-delayed\">delay to giving the £18bn project the green light</a> last week.</p> <p>Responding to the Xinhua report, the prime minister’s official spokeswoman said: “The PM’s focus is on making sure we take the right decision, recognising that we need a reliable and secure energy supply, recognising that nuclear energy is an important part of that.”<br /></p> <p>She would not be drawn on whether May had national security concerns about Chinese involvement in Hinkley or whether No 10 had had any contact with Chinese officials.</p> <p>However, she added: “This is just about taking the time to carefully consider all the component parts of the project. This is a big infrastructure decision and it’s right the new prime minister and new government take the time to make sure they are fully informed.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\">Vince Cable</a>, the Liberal Democrat former business secretary, had said May was previously against relaxing visa requirements for visiting Chinese businessmen when she was home secretary and had to be overruled by the then chancellor, George Osborne.<br /></p> <p>Cable suggested May had a “general prejudice” against Chinese investment due to national security concerns. “It came up in all kinds of different ways. Osborne kept pushing for more liberal treatment of visas for Chinese businessmen and she was very reluctant to go along with that. So I think she has form in adopting a more suspicious approach, more in line with the American position,” he told the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>When the UK government was led by David Cameron and Osborne, the UK courted Chinese investment and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/18/britian-has-made-visionary-choice-to-become-chinas-best-friend-says-xi\">lauded last year by China’s president, Xi Jinping, for the “visionary and strategic choice” to become Beijing’s best friend in the west</a>.</p> <p>Britain and France’s EDF first reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/britain-nuclear-power-station-hinkley-edf\">a broad commercial agreement on Hinkley Point C in 2013</a>, which has been dogged by concerns about its cost. China got involved two years later, via China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), and Downing Street laid on a state visit for Xi Jinping designed to cement a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/18/britian-has-made-visionary-choice-to-become-chinas-best-friend-says-xi\">“golden era”</a> of relations between the two countries.</p> <p>Asked if May has a different view on Chinese investment to her predecessor, her spokeswoman added: “The government has been clear Britain is open to business and wants to be attracting investment from all round the world.</p> <p>“Of course, the role China plays in world affairs, the global economy, we are going to continue to seek a strong relationship with China.”</p> <p>Whitehall moved last week to reassure Hinkley’s two foreign backers about the project’s viability after they were spooked by the UK’s shock delay.</p> <p>The UK refused to give immediate approval for the nuclear plant just two hours after EDF announced its board had approved construction of Hinkley Point C. EDF’s approval had been preceded by a week of blanket media coverage predicting that the project was about to be given the go-ahead.</p> <p>CGN, which would hold an estimated one-third stake in Hinkley, said on Saturday it respected the decision of the new British government to take the time needed to familiarise itself with the programme.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>EDF declined to

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/01/hinkley-point-c-critics-try-to-derail-it-amid-brexit-vote-turmoil\">Hinkley Point</a> nuclear plant from potential national security threats posed by China, a former cabinet minister has claimed.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat ex-energy secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ed-davey\">Ed Davey</a> said no explanation was given for the then chancellor’s decision to reject a pivotal “special share” in the Somerset project.</p> <p>“Concerns on Chinese involvement didn’t stand up to scrutiny last time round, but if the Treasury had adopted my proposal for a special share we could have included extra safeguards. But Osborne rejected it without explanation,” Davey told the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>The proposed special share in the consortium would have enabled the government to intervene on certain decisions to protect the national interest, Davey said.</p> <p>The claim came after the prime minister, Theresa May, was accused of having a “suspicious approach” to dealing with China over the Hinkley Point project.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the Lib Dem former business secretary, said May was against relaxing visa requirements for visiting Chinese businessmen when she was home secretary and had to be overruled by Osborne.</p> <p>Cable suggested May had a “general prejudice” against Chinese investment due to national security concerns.</p> <p>“It came up in all kinds of different ways. Osborne kept pushing for more liberal treatment of visas for Chinese businessmen and she was very reluctant to go along with that. So I think she has form in adopting a more suspicious approach, more in line with the American position,” he told the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>“My recollection was that when approval was sought for Hinkley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">she raised objections</a> on the grounds of national security issues with China. She has expressed, in several different contexts, severe reservations about China getting too close to the UK.”</p> <p>May caused shock in the business world when she ordered a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-to-go-ahead-after-edf-board-approves-project\">last-minute halt</a> to finalising the £18bn Hinkley Point project so the situation could be reviewed.</p> <p>Cable said the new prime minister’s more critical approach was right “once you separate that out from a kind of general prejudice against Chinese investment”.</p> <p>He said May was unhappy with what she saw as the government’s “gung-ho” approach to doing deals with Beijing when they were in cabinet together during the coalition.</p> <p>Another factor in the prime minister’s delay may be fear of a backlash over prices due to the unusually large sum French energy giant EDF will be paid for generating power from Hinkley – £92.50 per megawatt hour of electricity generated.</p> <p>Security concerns centre on the one-third stake the Chinese state has in the massive project. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, described the price levels involved as “disturbing” as he backed a review. But the boss of EDF, Vincent de Rivaz, has tried to calm the fears of workers by insisting he understands why May wanted more time to consider the project, while insisting the deal was still “strong”.</p> <p>The company’s board voted narrowly to give the final go-ahead for the long-delayed project but the government pulled back from signing the contract, saying it would make a decision in the early autumn.</p> <p>Downing Street will not comment on Cable’s claims, while the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, insists the government will “carefully consider” all the component parts of the project. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported that Treasury minister Jim O’Neill could quit the government over May’s new approach to China.</p>","wordcount":"566","creationDate":"2016-07-31T23:38:29Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-08-01T00:21:09Z","internalComposerCode":"579e8bf5e4b09895e25097f3","internalPageCode":"2626380","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-08-01T06:24:59Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pbj9","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/60c4db5da09b8b1645c5ab3767fa1af8d53cd88a/0_1284_3040_1823/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"379","internalShortId":"/p/4pbj9"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/01/osborne-rejected-safeguards-over-chinese-role-in-hinkley-point-says-ex-energy-minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/01/osborne-rejected-safeguards-over-chinese-role-in-hinkley-point-says-ex-energy-minister","webTitle":"Osborne

described the late decision as clumsy but understandable. </p> <p>“Certainly, when we were in government, Theresa May was, I think, quite clear that she was unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element

busy ruffling feathers over Hinkley Point | Deborah Orr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>EDF’s board had voted narrowly to give its final go-ahead for the long-delayed joint project on Thursday, only for Downing Street to pull back from signing the contract and say it would make a decision in the early autumn. The move surprised EDF executives, who were preparing to sign contracts with the government the next day. The company’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was forced to cancel a round of media interviews.</p> <p>Officials from China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project, were also expected to attend a media event in Somerset.</p> <p>De Rivaz has since written to workers in a bid to reassure them the £18bn project is still strong despite the unexpected delay. He said he had met the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, after the announcement that the government would “consider carefully” all parts of the project before making a decision.</p> <p>He wrote to employees: “My message today is one of continuity and confidence. The EDF board’s decision is a huge achievement and one we should be proud of. Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage. Our job now is to maintain the courage, patience and dedication that have served us so well.”</p> <p>Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef90e1ae66e1075bb180d2c4383bf85e3f1c2458\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef90e1ae66e1075bb180d2c4383bf85e3f1c2458/0_0_3500_2249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign marking the borders of the Hinkley Point C site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign marking the borders of the Hinkley Point C site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “Rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment.”</p> <p>One former cabinet minister said he believed it was “100%” down to Timothy’s intervention that the project had been stalled. “Nick is in an incredibly powerful position,” the source said. “Theresa listens to his every utterance, reads out his speeches and the reshuffle, I’m pretty sure, leads back to him. This is nothing to do with ministers. It will put [the chancellor] Philip Hammond’s nose out of joint and we shall have to see how that plays out.”</p> <p>The Tory MP in whose constituency the plant will be built, Ian Liddell-Grainger, said he did not believe Timothy could have been serious in his comments. He said: “All he was saying is that his concern is the amount of infrastructure that is going to the Chinese. But if that was the case, are we happy that Huawei are running Whitehall communications, as it is their hardware.</p> <p>“You know the Chinese are doing HS2? Are we saying we don’t want the Chinese to do anything and we don’t want their companies to be involved locally anywhere in the UK? The answer is no, that is not what he is saying. I don’t think there is any doubt that he has put forward an idea, but I don’t think he is serious about it.”</p> <p>The former Tory co-chairman Grant Shapps, who leads the all-party British Infrastructure Group, said MPs would be concerned if the pause continued beyond the autumn. He said: “If this is ‘stop, take a breathe, check the numbers and press ahead’, then fine, no one is going to begrudge. But if this is truly just another piece of big infrastructure where we bottle it and don’t do it, like airports, then that is bad news for Britain PLC.</p> <p>“Particularly that is the case post-Brexit when the world needs to see we are out there and prepared to engage internationally and frankly take international investment. Companies have to take pretty serious decisions about these kinds of investment. It makes deals more expensive in the future if we chop and change. So, benefit of doubt, but not for very long is my view.”</p> <p>Jason Millett, the chief operating officer for major programmes and infrastructure at Mace, a major contractor at Hinkley Point, added that the decision to delay had left people bewildered. “We are a little nervous. In the business we do, projects do have ups and downs and there are hurdles. We thought the EDF board decision would be the last hurdle. This is a new hurdle that’s been introduced,” he said.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","wordcount":"834","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-02T14:45:00Z","commentable":"false","creationDate":"2016-07-30T14:32:40Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T14:49:58Z","internalComposerCode":"579cba88e4b075867609e978","internalOctopusCode":"11767296","internalPageCode":"2626116","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-30T22:20:01Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

</figure>","body":"<p>Britain faces a problem in coping with its complex energy demands. It needs to provide extra energy to meet rising demands for power in coming decades but at a reasonable cost – while also reducing carbon emissions by considerable levels in order to meet its climate change commitments. This is not an easy combination to achieve. However, Hinkley Point was considered by many experts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-should-the-18bn-nuclear-power-station-be-built\">be a crucial aid in reaching these goals</a>.</p> <p>With its massive 3.2bn watt capacity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable\">Hinkley Point C would provide 7% of the nation’s electricity </a>when completed. Night and day, it would help to generate the power that would keep the nation working while renewable energy sources, mainly wind plants, would provide the rest of the electricity needed by homes and offices. “You have to have some baseload source to provide power when it is utterly calm and renewables are not providing energy,” explains Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute. “Gas and coal plants – which can also supply that baseload – will no longer be viable in future because of their carbon emissions, which cause global warming. You are then left with nuclear.”</p> <p>This dilemma reveals a major drawback that affects renewable energy. Wind and solar plants are intermittent power suppliers. They often provide power when it is not needed but fail to supply it when it is required. And until a method of storing energy on an industrial scale is developed, this drawback will continue to bedevil its deployment across the country. Research into ways to store energy on a large scale is now being pursued across the globe but may take decades. Similarly, other game-changing energy projects are being worked on.</p> <p>One of the most important of these is fusion power. This aims to recreate the process that provides the Sun with its energy. Nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused together at colossal temperatures inside huge reactors to create helium nuclei – and a great deal of excess energy, but little pollution or radioactive contamination. However, current devices – in particular the international Iter fusion reactor being built in France with British involvement – are currently years behind schedule and vastly over budget. Few experts believe fusion will get us out of our current energy problem.</p> <p>Alternatively, we could continue to use fossil fuel plants but take their carbon dioxide emissions, liquefy them and then pump into the ground, a procedure known as carbon capture and storage. Britain has huge, empty North Sea oil fields which many geologists and energy experts believe would be ideal for storing liquefied carbon dioxide. Several test projects were set up in recent years, with the government pledging to provide funding of up to £1bn until, in November last year, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/10/scrapping-carbon-capture-support-threatens-uk-climate-targets\">abruptly cancelled the programme</a>, halting work on all major British CCS projects.</p> <p>As Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said at the time: “This is devastating. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” These may prove to be prophetic words.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"5","wordcount":"502","commentCloseDate":"2016-08-02T18:45:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-07-30T16:04:38Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T18:47:40Z","internalComposerCode":"579cd016e4b00eff095cdc53","internalOctopusCode":"11767086","internalPageCode":"2626133","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-30T22:20:01Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Observer","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pba5","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/5531f16506c8dff72a1cbec0f58a8e2dce9cc91e/0_357_2760_1656/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"43","internalShortId":"/p/4pba5"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","webTitle":"Britain’s energy dilemma: if not nuclear power, then what?","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T18:47:40Z","sectionName":"UK news","sectionId":"uk-news","type":"article","id":"uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","editions":[{"id":"uk-news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false}}],"packageName":"Hinkley Point C EDF 2016","lastModified":"2016-08-09T13:54:37Z"}]}}
